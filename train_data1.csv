0,"Stephen king originally wrote this book to add more depth to the original story. He claims that these additions are like the bread crumbs in Hansel and Gretel and the glass slipper in Cinderella. I'm not sure exactly what he added because I never read the original cut version, but there were definetly parts of the story that could have been done without. According to the introduction, the Trashcan man's memorable journey across the desert seen through his freaky eyes was added, and the scene with Frannie and her mother. Not that these scenes weren't interesting, I just think that some of these little additions are more like someone taking a dump on the original story than magical, enchanting excerpts that added so much to the story. Sometimes I found myself thinking ""Was it really necessary to add that?""Apparently it was. Do you want to know what it's like to have a loaded gun shoved up your butt? This story takes the time to explain it.I loved parts of this mammoth of a book. My favorite character was Larry Underwood. It kept my attention for a long time and I found that I was still thinking about it after I finished reading it, which is a sign of a good book.The main complaint I have is that the characters spent so long getting where they were supposed to go that the apocalyptic end battle seemed weak and hurried in comparision. Also, Stephen King is not a very impartial god and he let the two most annoying characters live on, with divine intervention while almost everyone else got blown to hell. It really annoyed me.I thought, like his other book ""IT"" he couldn't manage to live up to the pages and pages of suspense and intricate plot twists that he spent so long building, and so the ending was anticlimatic.But-If you like long books then this is definetly something to check out because it is interesting and well thought out for the most part. It is also very, very entertaining, after all, getting there is half the fun right? These characters just spend a really long time getting there.",book

2,"I have to say that ""The Subtle Knife"" is another fantastic novel by Mr. Pullman in the ""His Dark Materials"" series. I couldn't put the book down and found the plot thoroughly entertaining and engrossing as it shifted from character to character, motive to motive, saga to saga. There was always a reason to continue reading as surprises and astounding revelations sharpened my focus and always kept me guessing. I can't wait to move on to the next book ""The Amber Spyglass"" as Mr. Pullman has done a splendid job crafting his first two books of the series (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife) and has earned another loyal fan through his efforts.",book
3,"This satire is just really, really dead-on, and nobody is spared. But even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed as ""Hynkel"", and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-German), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the movie's place in history. And the actors aren't even exaggerating that much I suppose. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the Jewish barber's ending speech, if only things could have ended in that way. It's not even really the character talking anymore, it's Chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie doesn't feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I don't care for is the slapstick, but that just comes with the era I suppose. This is an incredibly daring, harsh take on fascism, it's so hard-hitting still after all these years.",movie
4,This book has a great story and concept but its biggest weakness is its character depth. And this to me made all the difference in the world. If Lynch was able to bring the characters more alive I would have given this book 5 stars. It's got every other aspect to make it such a good book but the lack of feelings for the character is overwhelming. E.G. Lynch isn't afraid of killing off characters which is excellent-no writer should be afraid of this. But he'd kill a character and I'd just shrug because I never really felt a whole lot for the character to begin with. And he even kills off major characters so you'd think this would be even more significant. But it wasn't any different from when a minor character died to the major ones.,book
5,"This is a masterpiece, well written, extremely well organized contemporary style book. It is often compared to The Catcher in the Rye, while I think that the angst in this book isn't so apparent.For anyone who has suffered through a mental disorder or knows someone else who has, this is a must read as it is very articulate in how it describes the process of slipping into depression.",book

7,"I got Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was great in American Gothic) but sadly she didn't have a very big role in this film. It starts off OK and the pace moves along nicely...but by the end it starts getting a bit tedious and dull. That's not to say that this is a boring film, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. I didn't like the ""posession"" side of it and there were no decent gore scenes. Plus the 'main' story was very confusing and the ending doesn't make much sense at all. I did however like the story surrounding the Gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors.<br /><br />I wouldn't particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans - it's nothing to wet yourself over.",movie

First off, what a GREAT cocktail! I absolutely loved the extra spice. I got sriracha and jalape√±os on the side to add to my burger. They had great house sriracha. They were placing great music, I was dancing in my chair the whole time. The staff went out of there way to really be kind, coming by and asking if we needed anything at all and then another man coming by and asking us if the music volume was good for us. I would definitely recommend this place, we will be back!!",restaurant
9,"I found this book so satisfying, as there are really few well written books that are about horses or indeed about racing. And the style of the book, the way the many characters come & go, well, that is a lot the way racing is, too. Lots of everything, & you can't quite say with certainty what will happen tomorrow, who will come & go--lots of variables. I thought the people were wonderfully drawn, ie Rosalind, Joy, Dick, the youngsters with ""abilities"" to ""see"", & on & on. I wished the book were 4 times longer. I just couldn't get enuf of it. Really really appreciated Smiley's expertise on the horses, as well as the understanding of the track, AND her dextrous way of talkin'.",book
10,"This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle.<br /><br />The Original Drum and Bass.<br /><br />There seems to be very little early Who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be 'aving it, now-a-days it tends to be of a very different kind of Who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. To be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they've earned their respect and with overtime.<br /><br />This concert footage for me is one of their best. To command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of bloody good music.<br /><br />We all know of the other acts on the bill, The Doors (their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point being that whoever were there it was The Who that the majority had come to see. This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960's; Woodstock. The film and record had come out and so had The Who's greatest work to date, Tommy. The ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to ""Grove and Love"" in the knowledge that this gig was their own. To do this you needed the best of what Rock 'n Roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd.<br /><br />At two 'o clock in the morning in late August 1970 the M.C. announces, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, a small Rock 'n Roll band from Shepherds Bush London, the 'OO"".<br /><br />John Entwistle's body suit is of black leather, on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel's and long flowing hair, Keith in a white t-shirt and jeans, as Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins that he'd preferred to wear.<br /><br />The Who never stopped their onslaught of High Energy Rock for over two hours, performing theirs and other artists' greatest tracks such as Young Man Blues, Shaking' all Over, and then as on queue, Keith baiting the crowed to ""Shut up, it's a bleeding Opera"" with Tommy, the Rock Opera. The crowed went wild. This is what they had come to hear, and the Who didn't disappoint, straight into Overture and never coming up for air until the final note of ""Tommy can you Hear me?"" Amazing.<br /><br />To capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a Festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the World was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History.<br /><br />The English DVD only comes in a soundtrack of English/Linear PCM Stereo, were as in the States, I think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, ""Check local press for details¬Ö"" on that, okay.<br /><br />The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a slice of Rock and Festival History this DVD would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best Who concert footage as it was meant to be, Live, Raw and in your Face!<br /><br />I would have given this DVD ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice.<br /><br />Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith.",movie
11,The manager at this Cracker Barrel is extremely rude. I can't explain anymore how dissatisfied my experience was at this location without keeping my language clean. She was being rude to Mathias who was doing his job by taking names on the waiting list when she decided to embarrass him in front of everyone for being slow. My wife confronted her about the situation and she then proceeded to turn her hostile demeanor towards my family. She doesn't need to be in that position. I strongly suggest a demotion or even termination. Absolutely absurd. We come here every Sunday after church and Jennifer ruined our experience and our meal.,restaurant
12,"Probably because this is Columbia's first film in color, the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasing. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, who is an outlaw that wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman that starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess that runs the saloon. There is a funny character called Nitro that does not think twice before blowing it. I particularly enjoyed two moments of the film, one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses, there was no computer to help at that time, so I presume they must have gathered all those horses, no easy task. Another moment is the final shootout, technically very good. There is also quite a fistfight. Seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes, makes you come to a sad conclusion: They don't make them anymore. Would they be able to in case they wanted? I have my doubts.",movie

The pomelo salad was super interesting. I've never seen this on any menu before, and I'm really glad we got it. We was perfectly tart, spicy, and refreshing.

Onto food, this may have been my favorite dish I had while vacationing in Austin. Shakshouka was described by our waitress as ""a saucy, baked egg dish"" and that's exactly what it was.

I will definitely crave this!

18,"Liongate has yet to prove itself. Every single movie from lionsgate has been abysmal. i've tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just keep slapping me over and over again. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception.<br /><br />I couldn't even pay attention to most of this movie it was so frustrating and bad.<br /><br />here's the plot. Guy cuts up dead dog for some reason. Gets infected by random virus, transfers it to kids at a camp, kids start to get infected and die, town finds out about it and rather than help them, kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. the end.<br /><br />Seriously, that's the whole movie.<br /><br />all the characters are completely retarded, you don't care for any of them, and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world. Me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie. We did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming bulls$@t, because this film will make you do that.<br /><br />and i'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and hickish. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? why did the kid the hicks were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him? that was part of the two of their's plan? wow. best plan ever. i cannot believe this movie got a theatrical release. i could barely stomach the DVD, let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half. It wasn't scary, or funny, or cool, or anything. it's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could be using to...i don't know, plant a tree or something. it's more productive than this piece of garbage. The acting, special effects, and script are a joke. don't ever pick this up.<br /><br />Cabin fever gets one nasty leg shaving scene, out of 10",movie
19,"Overall, this is a pretty bad film. But for $5 at PathMark, it wasn't a total waste.<br /><br />The whole scenario has to do with a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes, supposedly from a magic curse. The actors/actresses aren't names that are big (even though some look like from TV shows), so I won't do my usual Troy McClure thing.<br /><br />For awhile, the film holds your interest as the couple hop a train and travel to L.A. to see a shaman to undo the curse. There's a bit of other plots going on too; like two ladies smuggling drugs.<br /><br />But the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total let down. As violent and gory as the whole film is, the grand finale is just totally computer animated.<br /><br />I saw the unrated version which had tons of language, gore, blood, violence, everything! The bonus features were OK.<br /><br />Overall Grade: D-",movie
20,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a timeless classic. This is a book that warrants more than one reading, it is a keeper, with a special place of it's own.

Both the tree and Francie are able to rise above the adversity and thrive.The characters are lively and real. The main character, Francie, who is articulate and bright, desperately seeks affection from her mother. Katie Nolan, is a mother that can not recripricate that love to her daughter. Instead, Katie directs her energy and affection to her son. Neeley. Francie is drawn to her father, a local drunkard, who pays her much attention. The reader expereinces the pain of growing and reconciling her relationships with her family.Francie Nolan is a survivor. The reader will follow Francie as she faces numerous challenges and diversions in life. We watch as she learns and becomes resourceful. We struggle with her during the hard and traumatic times in her life.

The name carries over from a 70s' multi star cast, which the 2002 version also boasts of. The story is taken from the 70s' Sunil Dutt/Reena Roy starrer - ""Nagin"" and visual effects taken (a horrible attempt) from The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II.<br /><br />Set in a college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - college kids!!!???!!), Manisha Koirala is the victim, who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our heros. As it turns out Manisha is a Cobra (Nag) snake reborn as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life, now a super powerful-all-and-any-shape-assuming (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is out looking for her in this life. Manisha appeals to him to avenge her violation and murder.<br /><br />So begins the mad killing spree, where the avenging lover starts singling each male of the group, with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts. The effects are extremely cheap, with computer generated skeletons, morphing bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce.<br /><br />Carry over from Nagin includes Raj Babbar playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more ""Religiously correct"" multi-religion locket (the original Nagin only had an ""Om"") . Sunny Deol plays Manisha's love interest in her current life and the ultimate saviour against the all powerful Munish Kohli.<br /><br />Music and songs are below average.<br /><br />Avoid if you don't fancy cheap thrills.",movie

It is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together. The gore factor is superb, however. Even right at the very beginning, you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense. Only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it. I've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events, however you can not find any information about it online...so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.",movie
32,"Being the first Jane Austen novel which I have ever read, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Pride and Prejudice was nothing at all as I had expected. Full of wit and humor, as well as a romance both entirely innocent and mature (a virtue sadly lacking in much of this age's romances), Pride and Prejudice also conveys the polished skill with which Austen writes. I was most surprised to find that Austen, with her sophisticated style, was in her late teens/early twenties when she wrote this novel.I could easily go on about her style, vocabulary, and intricate sentences (I had a little trouble following her sometimes), but the main focus should always be given to the story itself. Insightful and often hilarious characterization gave texture to the story, as did the complex personalities of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bennet's off-hand remarks and Mary's deeply celebral, pompous observations on morality brightened up the scenery considerably. Jane Austen exercises expert storytelling to catch (and keep) interest until the very realistic, very satisfying, conclusion.Pride and Prejudice has earned its way onto my ""feel-good"" list of books, and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it for many years to come. Don't be discouraged by its old-fashioned front. Pride and Prejudice is one story that no one should be deprived of.Oh, and if you haven't seen the movie, go see it!",book

40,"From: www.BasilAndSpice.comAuthor & Book Views On A Healthy Life!Book Review: Better by Atul Gawande, MDDr. Atul Gawande, General Surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital--Boston, Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School, Staff Writer for The New Yorker, and Best-Selling author of Better writes about the importance of washing hands and how to actually cut the spread of potential lethal disease. He states that approximately two million Americans pick up an infection while in the hospital. Of these, ninety thousand will die from that same infection. Possible attacks come from rotavirus, Norwalk virus, Pseudomonas bacteria, resistant Klebsiella, MRSA-- methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and VRE-- vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus--the last two frequently causing pneumonias, wound and bloodstream infections.Admittedly, Dr. Gawande recognizes that studies show nurses and doctors do not wash their hands frequently enough, up to 50% of the time. Recalling the lesson taught by obstetrician Ignac Semmelweis, he points out the cause of childbed fever (puerperal fever) was the lack of washing hands. In 1847, 600 of 3,000 mothers delivering babies in Semmelweis's Viennese hospital, died from the bacteria Streptococcus, which leads to childbed fever. After instigating a wash up with chlorine and a nail brush for doctors and nurses, between patients, the death rate fell from 20% to 1%. Even though this procedure offered sufficient proof of success, doctors elsewhere declined to institute the hand washing. They simply could not believe that they themselves were making their patients sick.Recently, a surgeon named Jon Lloyd hit on an idea from the Save the Children program: Positive Defiance, or building upon capabilities people already have, rather than making them change their behaviors. After meeting with small groups (from kitchen worker and janitor to nurses, doctors, and even patients) in a trial Pittsburgh hospital, and instilling the staff's ideas, change was made. For example, they themselves decided where to best place new hand-gel dispensers. By empowering the employees, they worked together toward a common goal. The result at the end of one year, ""the entire hospital saw its MRSA wound infection rates drop to zero.""Dr. Gawande continues with news that The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Jewish Healthcare Foundation are beginning to implement this initiative in ten more hospitals across the United States. To this point, no other idea has worked.This is an excellent book.5 Stars",book

Who's the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards? I thought the lead actor(George Calil) was particularly inept. Apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake, I thought using the events of 9/11 as a reason to make ""Larson the Lunatic Implodes, all over a screen near you"" disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9/11.

42,"I don't think people were prepared to read a book about a woman not wanting to be a good wife or a mother. Kate Chapin introdused us to something very different but very beautiful at the same time. who understands a woman better than a woman herself? I think that Chapin was able to free herself through the character Edna Potellier, and one of the reasons why this book seems so honest is because you get the feeling that somebody actually lived through this. Chapin was able to shed some light for the darkness that women lived with. The Chartacter Edna is a symbol of freedom and liberation, showing a strong and defying person,she becomes an outcast to the typical women. Edna, unlike other woman has never really been shaped to be the house wife she was supposed to be, and because of this she could never be the mother or wife she would like to be; and besides it wouldn't make sense to trun yourself as a person to yourfamily,when all youv'e ever had was freedom in your vains. When this book came out, I'm pretty sure it come out with a scream that left the norm thinking about where the good woman had gon. Many people belived that this book made a woman look very selfish and weak because she was unable to do a job that God gave the woman,the priviledge to take care of that what a woman should take care of, but I on the other hand found myself very satisfied at the end. Society has the perfect picture of a woman, so was Edna a broken woman; or was she simple just a woman with wings?",book
43,"I'd say this book was worth the $10.00. Most of what she says in her book, I have seen on the show though. It is not necessary to buy the book if you can watch the show every week. I also second what the other reviewers say about it being very basic. If your child is having a few small problems (dressing, eating), she touches on these subjects. The book doesn't go into any great detail.",book
44,"I can't believe people are looking for a plot in this film. This is Laural and Hardy. Lighten up already. These two were a riot. Their comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago. Not a filthy word out of either mouth and they were able to keep audiences in stitches. Their comedy wasn't sophisticated by any stretch. If a whoopee cushion can't make you grin, there's no reason to watch any of the stuff these guys did. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at stuff that was funny without a plot. I guess it takes a simple mind to enjoy this stuff, so I qualify. Two man comedy teams don't compute, We're just too sophisticated... Aren't we fortunate?",movie
45,"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens.",book

48,"I will admit that I did not give this movie much of a chance. I decided pretty early on that this just wasn't my kind of movie.<br /><br />For the most part, it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography. The scenes of early 70's Manhattan look very good, as does the lead actress. It is a very crisp black and white, which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh. However, some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell. The disjointed editing is VERY late-60's, somewhere between surrealism and new wave. The story also feels like it came from a very specific time, somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation.<br /><br />The film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with. As she meets other odd characters, she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs. The movie seems to be meant as an off-the-wall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde feel. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover The Telephone Book.<br /><br />Some problems I had: Near the end of the movie, one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes¬ó-brutal to sit through. Also, there is a very explicit animation sequence that I found gross and juvenile that serves as the film's climax. I did laugh out loud four or five times, and I liked the ending (minus the flat-out disgusting animation). And when the film switched to color for the final phone-booth-at-night sequence, I actually liked the way it looked even better. It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt like I could have really liked it if it been a little different. But this is what the filmmakers gave us. It is obscure, artsy, and way left of the dial, but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own. I didn't find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious.",movie

58,"I'll give it this: I didn't stop watching, and it's not corporate, which is kind of cool. But my internal critic cut it to pieces -- I suppose I see too many movies. Wooden script, the slang just sort of clanks out of their mouths without any kind of flow. Editing, mentioned before, is hit and miss; sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel, but mostly its irritating -- jerky, quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups. The actors were marginal, though Letisha had her moments.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the audience supposed to care about Curtis, he's a total screwup and the actor is entirely expressionless and not particularly funny or endearing. The directing doesn't help make you love him or hate him, even; I just wanted him to shut up and get shot already. I didn't care about his impotent vengeance when that rolled around. The completely predictable ending isn't credible at all. I'm not sure why we're supposed to believe that some erstwhile successful dealers he deposes are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams. ""Oh, you just got out of jail and are on probation? Here's thousands of dollars worth of cocaine, go run it around the corner for me. Now don't steal from me, etc.""<br /><br />A good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope, but it was let down in the end. Handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrow-raising, if only mildly interesting. There are better movies in this genre that don't insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a film-school offering. 4/10, an F.",movie
59,"I hated the original Willy Wonka movie. Gene Wilder was too smarmy, Charlie too bland and the Oompa-Loompas way too creepy. Hence, I saw no reason to read the book that inspired my loathing. But when I learned that Roald Dahl, author of the book, had actually dissociated himself from the Wonka adaptation, I though that maybe, just maybe, I might like the book.And I loved it!!The book outdoes the movie in every way. Charlie and his extended family are dirt poor and hence always hungry. A yearly birthday candy bar is all they can afford. The other children, winners of Wonka's Golden Tickets, are hopelessly sniveling, selfish, spoiled and self-absorbed. When they visit Wonka's chocolate factory, they are dispatched by their own greed and lack of discipline. The scenes where Veruca Salt is disposed of by a gang of shell-shucking squirrels is perfect. Dahl's Wonka is hyperkinetic, elfin and passionate about candy. He seems not to know or care where the disappearing children have gone. The Oompa Loompas are not the lumpish candy-men of the movie but a race of tiny people transplanted willingly to the factory. The only slightly disturbing part of the book was the way the nasty kiddos were got rid of, since they could have been drowned, incinerated, or blown up like balloons. But even this discomfort is addressed by book's end.The best part of the book was Dahl's inventive cleverness about dream up new and wonderful candies. Edible pillows, cavity-filling caramels and sweets that let you spit in many colors were just a few of his delectable concoctions. As were the long songs sung by the Oompa Loompas to celebrate the removal of bad kids. Schindelman's illustrations gave just enough of a hint at the action without taking the reader's imagination entirely off the hook. Dahl's moral sense is an important subtext throughout the book. Greed and boorishness are punished; virtue, good manners and self-restraint are rewarded. Compare that with the ethical confusion of the Wilder film.Definitely one of my favorite books in search of an adaptation that is true to the Dahl's spirit, which rewards the habit of reading books and other good behavior, even among the needy.",book
60,"Geoffrey Nunberg is, amongst other things, a professor of linguistics at Stanford University, but he's better known to most of us for his witty and perceptive commentaries on popular language usage. Going Nucular is a collection of 65 articles, each one based on a word that is commonly used in political speech. It's an eclectic list: terrorism, vision, freedom, r&eacute;gime, hero, torture, capitalism, postmodern, fascist, google. Then, of course, there's nuclear.I had a momentary fear on receiving this book that it would be yet another diatribe against (or for) the current president, who is well-known for his tendency to mispronounce nuclear as ""nucular."" But the author reminds us that this word has tripped up a series of presidents from Dwight D Eisenhower to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton. Nunberg's point, as usual, is more subtle. He notes that some of the people who talk of ""nucular weapons"" have no difficulty pronouncing ""nuclear family."" So are they really stubbing their toes on a hard-to-say word or are they indulging in faux-folksy speech?Warning to grammarians: Nunberg has no patience with the dictionary police. In his opinion, English is at its best in creative hands - just think of Shakespeare. How we use and change words gives those with the ear to hear a wealth of information about how we think. Consider how the media describe those folk in Iraq who oppose US policy. Terrorists? Insurgents? Freedom fighters? Rebels? Patriots? Whichever word is chosen reveals a bias.All the articles in ""Going Nucular: Language, Politics, and Culture in Confrontational Times"" originally appeared either on National Public Radio's Fresh Air or one of several major newspapers over the past few years.

61,"This series has been sitting in my to-read pile for quite a while, and now that I have finished it, I am so happy that I finally picked it up! It's written by a mother-daughter writing team, which is interesting and rather sweet. The characters (and there are a lot of them) are rather well done, with witty dialogue exchanges and entertaining relationships. The plot's a pretty twisty one, staying pretty unpredictable right up until close to the end. Unfortunately, the book doesn't flow as smoothly as books by other writing duos - but this is just the first book in this promising series. I have full confidence that these issues will be sorted out in the subsequent novels.The amount of characters in the novel really slowed it down, though. And the two police detective pairs and their doppelganger-descriptions seem to purposefully incite confusion in the reader, which feels a bit pointless (I mean, all that build up for a dated reference to a Bette Midler/Lily Tomlin movie?). But that aside, it is a fun read and I am looking forward to seeing just where this mother-daughter team will bring the series in the next book!",book

63,"Get this film if at all possible. You will find a really good performance by Barbara Bach, beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house, and an unexpected virtuoso performance by ¬Ö ""The Unseen"". I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Bach, whom I'd just viewed in ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. So: we start with a nice fresh premise. TV reporter Bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a California town, Solvang, that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. She brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. (The late Karen Lamm plays Bach's sister, and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to, it is just too funny watching Bach (Mrs. Ringo Starr) and Lamm (Mrs. Dennis Wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) Anyway ¬Ö Bach's disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang, as he's not done arguing with her. There's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career. The ladies arrive in Solvang to do the assignment for their station, only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (Maybe to Bach's boyfriend, because think of it ¬ñ where's he gonna stay?). The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. Mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum, they catch the interest of proprietor Mr. Keller (the late Sidney Lassick), who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home, insisting his wife will be happy to receive them. Oh no! Next thing we know Keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife, warning her that company's coming and threatening that she'd better play along. Trouble in paradise! The ladies are eager to settle in and get back to Solvang to shoot footage and interview Swedes, but one of the girls doesn't feel good. Bach and Lamm leave her behind, wondering to themselves about Mrs. Keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty Lelia Goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. Speaking of which ¬Ö under-the-weather Vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub, not realizing that Keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. She hears him, thinks he's come to deliver linen, and calls out her thanks. Lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn't get a long enough look. After he's left, poor Vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent, frightening round of action) by something BIG that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor ¬Ö The Unseen! Lamm comes home next (Bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and can't find anyone in the house. She knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen, and, on hands and knees to collect it, her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille ¬Ö attracting The Unseen again! Well, at about the time poor Lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen, we do a flashback into Mr. Keller's past and get the full story of what his sick, sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn't smile much. Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. Meanwhile, Lassick has been apprised of the afternoon's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can't let Bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home. He tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the Keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us.<br /><br />I cannot say enough for Stephen Furst, whom I'd never seen before; it's obvious that he did his homework for this role, studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; Bach and Goldoni, each in their diverse way, just give the movie luster. Not only that, but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. No stupid cheap tricks, eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners... A real treat for your collection.",movie

I have found so many mistakes in the way it is set up - I am an advanced beginner I would say - rated about 700 by the United States Chess Federation.I will start by saying that I learned to use my King in the endgame. The books shows me how to move the Queen a Knights move away to force checkmate without the King. This takes me much longer. The checkmate with the Rook boxes in the King in the book - I learned to line up the Kings and check with my Rook from my chess teacher which is so much better.I also spotted that the same positions were reapeated two times in the book (see pages 7 Diagram B and page 46) a big mistake.The sample moves for games sometimes shows where the mistake was made and sometimes it doesn't. I want to know where the player when wrong in the opening moves that allowed the checkmate and know what should have been done. This is not covered.My favorite book covering checkmates called ART OF THE CHECKMATE is much, much better (though it used the old form of chess notation). Talking about notation of moves this book suddenly starts using a long form of chess notation toward the end of the book when they should have kept it the same.I cannot help joking and saying I will give this book away to a player at our school who is good and challenges me, so he can learn the mistakes in the book and then I can beat him!

The paragraph-long ""plot summary"" written on the movie page has details I could not glean from watching the actual movie. I found myself constantly backing it up to see what details I had just missed which could tell me what the (bleep) was going on. Alas, to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story, if you could call it a story. It's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here, filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations. Newsflash to the the creators: I paid to watch you MAKE a movie. I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is somebody I've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I figured okay, maybe she didn't really want the role, just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. Next time you produce something, don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Also, somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes, I hate to say it, but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats. That's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters. The Adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist. As for the Maya character, she didn't seem like a real person. Anyway I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made.",movie

Nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning. The three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together. The writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes. This is a good film that I probably won't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy. Good film.,movie
78,"THE KING MAKER will doubtless be a success in Thailand where the similar (but superior) 'The Legend of Suriyothai' set box office records. The film directed by Lek Kitaparaporn after a screenplay by Sean Casey based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest, pedestrian scripts and story development on film.<br /><br />The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch) whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked, captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in Ayutthaya in the kingdom of Siam where he is purchased by the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of her father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies), a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses. There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong (Dom Hetrakul), after some gratuitous CGI enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness, are first rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards, only to be imprisoned together once Queen Sudachan (Yoe Hassadeevichit) reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) to take over the rule of Siam. Yet of course Fernando and Tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families (Tong's wife and children and Fernando's now firm love affair with Maria) with the expected consequences.<br /><br />The acting (with the exception of John Rhys-Davies) is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp. The predominantly Thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog, making us wish they had used their native Thai with subtitles. The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas. But if it is visual splendor you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching. It is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions. It is just the basics that are missing. Grady Harp",movie
79,"Pretty good for a quick bite. Not the best bao I've ever had, not the worst either. It was fast, relatively inexpensive and pretty tasty, sort of. If you're near the university and need something later at night, I think they're open till 10 or 1030 on Saturday's, this place will be an ok choice. The truffle tots were hot and crispy, not much in the way of truffle flavor. My pork belly was really, really slimy and fatty, almost inedible, not the best, but it happens, might have been a fluke. I couldn't eat it and ended up throwing it away on the ride back to Tampa. I also ordered the Korean beef bao, it was just ok. The spicy chicken was my favorite. The service was not great, the male cashier's zipper was down and no one seemed to care that there were customers in the restaurant, not sure if this is the orlando norm but wow... no customer service at all. It also smelled vaguely of urine back by the soda machine. For cleanliness and ambiance I'd give them 1 star. For the food 3 stars. Get it to go.",restaurant

84,"The first film was a nice one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. The film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is pleasant. The acting is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, as it was with the first film, is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more evil than she was previously. Overall, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox",movie
85,"Movie: There are some very interesting comments on IMDb about this movie. Its truly awful. Not enough money is spent on the movie and the way Spike Lee has made it, it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick. Characters/Actors: Denzel has done ""EXACTLY"" what he does in every movie, so no surprise there. Here is a little mind game for the readers. Quickly think of 10 Denzel movies. Now count how many of them were in which he played a cop/detective/body guard, whatever. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a better role on his plate soon. His best performance was I think in ""Beyond Borders"". Other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well. His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in ""Sin City"". Surely this guy knows acting, what he doesn't know is better way of choosing roles. He is in desperate need of a better agent. Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie, if you are watching her for the first time in your life. She has done better. She has had better roles. It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie. Plot: Plot was not confusing, in fact, I could think of such a plot, in fact the whole movie, while taking a dump after a nice big Chinese dinner. I mean come on, ****SPOILER ON THE WAY----> I am sick of the un-necessary Haulocast and the Racism token. The movie is about bank robbers, why put the Haulocast and the Racism in there, nice try playing with people's emotions, worked on anyone? NOT ME. Police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages? Riiiiiiight, please, we're talking about US police force and security here. Nobody could find out where Clive was, I mean they didn't find anything different with that room. Who're we kidding? Conclusion: Sure, go watch this movie, if nothing, you'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was. At least people won't think you're stupid to go watch this movie because they'd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast ""MISTAKE"".",movie
86,"The film is about a sabretooth on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a scavenger hunt. Since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off. The deaths are cheesy and are dumb. But at least it had better effects then sabretooth. I gave it a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was okay but some deaths were off-screen. There was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the sabretooth's head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out. Then the sabretooth gets up in the vents and bites the kids head off. The end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics. Even that death was stupid because the statues tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts doesn't find them, and seems like she doesn't need the.

87,"I loved this book because, simply put, Stephen McLeod has a crush on the world. Like a lot of crushes, this one breathes it all in. With startling detail it records all it sees, invests emotional risk at the least prompting, and generally rockets like a Texas bareback rider through the exquisite and beautiful sadness of it all. As I said - a crush. Thrilling, the nearness of the intoxication, the pure living breath of the beloved. But, unlike a lot of other crushes, this one is actually requited. Requited by the poems that result from this enamored encounter with the world. Poems whose mere existence is proof of what the beholder receives from the beloved. That chance to gaze without apology on beauty incarnate. Line after line confirms this love affair consummated by the poet's fluent observation of the world in which he lives. McLeod's is a poetry of style and wit, and yet it's constantly open to the weak-kneed sweet surrender of the human heart as it travels toward its inexplicable destiny. Seventy-five years after Hart Crane wrote, &quot;Permit me voyage, love, into your hands...&quot; Stephen McLeod's poems complete that journey.",book

The Chicken Tenders and Wings here are consistently good in taste and texture.  The Fried Chicken was on the harder and darker side, perhaps the batch we had was overcooked.  The onion rings were big and fat, which we were not a fan of.  Jack-Fruit Po'Boy was not bad, lots of filling and could be quite messy to eat.

I always have the same thing so it's pretty simple but because it's a special order, sometime the cashier has to ask for assistance but yet, never have they huffed or puffed, but instead took the order with a smile.

92,"With an interesting premise (in the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear), this should have been a good film. But the story is sabotaged by the director's overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script.<br /><br />Yes, the natural setting is beautiful and, yes, the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting. But the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again, adding layer upon layer of over-the-top musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over, to the soundtrack, that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and, by calling attention to themselves, take away from the story.<br /><br />To me, it was clear the director, with his microscopic closeups and the endless recurrence of the musical motif of ""Danny Boy"" (of all things!) was trying to make a New Zealand version of an epic Sergio Leone film, something on the order of Once Upon A Time In The West. But given the earnestness of the story (most of Leone's westerns were tongue-in-cheek), not to mention that it's no longer 1968, he succeeds in making a parody of one.<br /><br />Too bad.",movie
93,"Yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually an engrossing show, that I try not to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is fairly good, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I like The Bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. It is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox",movie
94,"I've seen this movie twice on Transilvania International Film Festival(TIFF), the movie is in competition and I really hope that Esteban Sapir will get one of the awards (at least the best image award). <br /><br />As a silent cinema fan I'm interested in contemporary movies that quote or recreate the language of the yester-year cinema. The previous reviewer emphasized the quotes from Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it, the movie references directly Lang's Metropolis, and the allegorical-parabolic character of his plots. But I didn't see Murnau in it. There's a more obvious Melies-homage though: the Moon with a (here cigar-smoking) human face, and the paper-made, painted mountains and city-landscapes. I enjoyed the film mostly for its visuals, and in the meantime I found very interesting the story on muteness, and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the voiceless city. From this perspective this movie is an unique reflexion on the muteness of the silent cinema, because in the films of the silent period one can hardly find stories with mute characters. In this case can be questioned whether the story on the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form, or there's an intention to play upon the muteness of the silent films. Another example of this kind of reflexion I found in Guy Maddin's Careful,where the inhabitants of a mountain-village have restrictions in using their voices. I intend to write a paper on it, if you know movies related to this topic, please let me know!!! <br /><br />I highly recommend Esteban Sapir's film to every moviegoer (one of the critics called it: the jewel of the festival).<br /><br />PS: Winners were announced, and the film won the award for best cinematography!",movie

101,"Great retelling of King Arthor after Mallory. Don't get bogged down in historical inacuracies or the fact that Arthur is Norman rather than Welsh like in most recent versions. King Arthor isn't a real person he is a real legend and he has been evolving for centuries. Sometimes he's a Celtic warlord other time a Roman general and other times a Norman king. Often Lancelot is by his side, but Lancelot is a French invention added to the story centuries after it originated. So just enjoy this story as fiction, and Legend and don't worry about the &quot;real&quot; king Arthor. The Once and Future King is actually four books (a fifth, The Book of Merlin, is also available but it isn't nearly as good.) Of the four books Ill Made Knight is the best as it deals with Lancelot and Guenivere's affair with such poignancy and heart. The Queen of Air and Darkness is often unecessarily silly and is the worst of the four (I'd give it three stars by itself.) But the whole is an incredible epic. Well worth your time.",book
102,"This early Sirk melodrama, shot in black and white, is a minor film, yet showcases the flair of the German director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art. Set in the 1910's, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her small-town husband and family for the lure of the Chicago stage. She never fulfilled her ambitions, and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre (a high school production, that is). Back in her old town she once again comes up against small-mindedness, and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, bewildered (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and ex-lover. The plot is nothing new but Sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions, with every frame carefully shot, and he is aided immeasurably by having Stanwyck as his leading lady. It runs a crisp 76 minutes, and that's just as well, because the material doesn't really have the legs to go any further.",movie

We also had the Spanish rice and pinto and black beans. I loved the carnitas, one of the best I've ever had. The meat was soft and moist. My 2 year old was even able to eat it because it wasn't chewy, which I appreciated. The tacos al pastor were salty with the initial taste, but after a couple chews, I think it tagged more tart than salty - maybe too much lime? It was also quite chewy. Toppings were all very fresh. The gentlemen serving us was so personable. He was great, I wish I got his name. We also ordered some churro bites which he brought out to us and even brought me a lid to help hide them from my daughter's view until after she ate her food.

111,"This film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him. However, somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn't know where to go from there.<br /><br />One unbelievable event followed the next (Russia must be very small because they are all bumping into each other all the time), the motivation of the female lead character comprehensible (why does she still follow him after they got off the ship? Why doesn't she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny? And what was the story with the younger sister about?). Still with all this seeming arbitrariness of the plot, the movie managed to be completely predictable.<br /><br />The saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential.

Often in the show it brings ""girl power"" to a new high, with girls beating guys in everything they try. But that is not the worst. The worst is that girls are nevertheless all portrayed as being focused on their personal appearances, and screaming whenever they are happy. Except for the one smart girl, who is portrayed as a freak who is obsessed with ugly boys and science. However, this show is very addictive. I do not know why, but it is.

First off, let me commend Nixta on the smoothest order and pickup process. The guy who took my order over phone (their website was not working) was friendly, listened and made good recommendations. Curbside pickup was a breeze.

After my initial bad experience with Nixta, I was a hesitant to try again.

The book is short and very easy too read (almost to easy), the narrative is simple and entertaining, again, like a fable.But what is the strongest side of Animal Farm? For me, the time period when it was written. This means, that today you will enjoy this book, but not as much as somebody who read it when it was first published. For example, if you read the book thinking that it was written last year, you would probably think that it's ok, another interesting form of telling the story of Communism, but just that. To really appreciate the novel you have to bear in mind who Orwell was and when did he write the book.But it is definetely a worth reading novel, a well spent couple of hours.",book

Despite its random and too often erroneous misconceptions (the man couldn't figure out how double mail was made or what it was even though he had seen it on several occasions) it offers an ecclectic smattering of the arms and armour Stone encountered during his lifetime.

129,"It's unfortunate that Wuthering Heights often gets lumped into the category of Victorian chick lit, because it probably has more in common with Dickens or Balzac than with Jane Austen. The various film adaptations often make much of the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, but that doesn't begin to cover the scope of this book. Wuthering Heights is no conventional romance novel. It is in fact an epic examination of human wickedness involving an ensemble cast that spans two generations over the course of almost 50 years. Filled with powerful imagery and unforgettable characters, it makes for a profoundly entertaining read.Heathcliff, a gypsy-looking street urchin from Liverpool, is adopted by the Earnshaw family, who live among the moors of northern England at the secluded estate of Wuthering Heights. Mr. Earnshaw treats Heathcliff as his favorite, much to the consternation of his eldest son Hindley. When the father dies, Hindley seizes the opportunity to retaliate against Heathcliff, revoking his favored family position and forcing him to labor in the fields. Meanwhile, Heathcliff and his adopted sister Catherine develop a love for each other, but due to his servant status, dirty boots, and surly demeanor, she spurns him for her more elegant and refined neighbor Edgar Linton. Heathcliff resolves to revenge himself upon all who have hurt him, and the following generation of Earnshaws, Lintons, and Heathcliffs must also suffer the repercussions of his passionate vengeance.The joy of Wuthering Heights is that there isn't a single character in the book who could be described as a good person. They are all at best selfish and petty, at worst deplorably evil. All are set on destroying each other, not through murder or violence, but by making each other's lives a living hell until one by one they gradually drop dead of sorrow or destitution. Emily Bronte's unrelenting audacity in depicting the cruelest, basest aspects of humanity is so refreshing it's a joy to read. Yet over and above its sensationalistic pleasures, Wuthering Heights is undeniably a meaningful piece of literature with an intricately constructed plot and keen insights into human nature. It offers important lessons on the poisoning effects of resentment and vengeance upon the soul, as well as the resilience of the human spirit to rise above adversity and degradation.The one drawback of Wuthering Heights is its narrative voice, as told through the perspective of a visitor, Mr. Lockwood, which results in some rather convoluted constructions (Lockwood says that Nelly said that Cathy read in a letter that Linton wrote that Heathcliff told Hareton . . . ). The story would have been better served by a third-person omniscient perspective. Nevertheless, Wuthering Heights deserves its renown as a classic of English literature. It's a shame this is the only novel Emily Bronte ever finished. Let the chick-lit label be damned; real men read Wuthering Heights too!",book
130,"""Don't be greedy"" sums up the depth of this movie. All the rest of the baloney is big budget window dressing. The movie rotates through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much. None of the potentially interesting plot tangents are developed yet the trite ones are hashed and rehashed to excess.<br /><br />The charm of DD, as others have pointed out, was in the schizophrenia device,the humor woven into the fabric of the movie, and most importantly, the acting. There is enough wooden acting in The Box to attract a giant mound of martian termites.<br /><br />The biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the glaring question, ""why would a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all?"" Awful failure of a movie.",movie
131,"This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Don't bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and I'm still wondering what the heck Bill Paxton was doing in this film? And why the heck does he always play the exact same character? From Aliens onward, every film I've seen with Bill Paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in Aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...<br /><br />Overall, this is second-rate action trash. There are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch Judgement Night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. The only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.",movie
132,"Omen IV: The Awakening starts at the 'St. Frances Orphanage' where husband & wife Karen (Faye Grant) & Gene York (Michael Woods) are given a baby girl by Sister Yvonne (Megan Leitch) who they have adopted, they name her Delia. At first things go well but as the years pass & Delia (Asia Vieria) grows up Karen becomes suspicious of her as death & disaster follows her, Karen is convinced that she is evil itself. Karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next Antichrist & gets a shock when she finds out who Delia's real father was...<br /><br />Originally to be directed by Dominique Othenin-Girard who either quit or was sacked & was replaced by Jorge Montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone's guess as Omen IV: The Awakening is absolutely terrible & a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors. The script by Brian Taggert is hilariously bad, I'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that I find even that hard to believe. As a serious film Omen IV: The AWakening falls flat on it's face & it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof, I mean the scene towards the end when the Detective comes face-to-face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous Gothic song has to be seen to be believed & I thought it was absolutely hilarious & ridiculous in equal measure. Then there's the pointless difference between this & the other Omen films in that this time it's a young girl, the question I ask here is why? Seriously, why? There's no reason at all & isn't used to any effect at all anyway. Then of course there's the stupid twist at the end which claims Delia has been keeping her brother's embryo inside herself & that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of Satan worshippers it has been implanted in Karen so she can give birth to the Antichrist is moronic & comes across as just plain daft. At first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later.<br /><br />It's obviously impossible to know how much of Omen IV: The Awakening was directed by Girard & Montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it's a shabby, cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made-for-TV & it shows with the bland, flat & unimaginative cinematography & production design. Then there's the total lack of scares, atmosphere, tension & gore which are the main elements that made the previous Omen films so effective.<br /><br />The budget must have been pretty low & the film looks like it was. The best most stylish thing about Omen IV: The Awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as Delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything. I have to mention the music which sounds awful, more suited to a comedy & is very inappropriate sounding. The acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys.<br /><br />Omen IV: The Awakening is rubbish, it's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious & just ends up coming across as stupid. The change of director's probably didn't help either, that's still not a excuse though. The last Omen film to date following the original The Omen (1976), Damien: Omen II (1978) & The Final Conflict (1981) all of which are far superior to this.",movie
133,"Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me. I either really love them or I loathe them. Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is one that I really do enjoy and watch it regularly.<br /><br />The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her,but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother.<br /><br />Although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. Like most Stephen King stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. The acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption.<br /><br />For UK readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller/Horror channels.",movie

I bought this on very budget DVD and I'm glad because it's not worth much. This isn't even one of those films that's so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk/high and have a good giggle. I didn't hate it like I hate some films, but it is rather boring, and not worth investing any time in.<br /><br />The only people who voted 10 on the votes for this film must have been connected to it somehow because I cannot imagine anyone actually liking this film other than small children passing time",movie
135,"OK, plain and simple, if you are a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP AWAY FROM LEGEND.<br /><br />It is, without doubt, the most disappointing TR game yet. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is totally unplayable and I've given up. I feel like I've been robbed by Eidos.<br /><br />It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games the controls were standard. In AOD they were 'tacky', but still the same general control sequences. In Legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollable.<br /><br />I have seen comments elsewhere from people who say 'Use the mouse'. No, why should I? Others say 'Use a gamepad'. No, why should I? Others say 'But this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years' Well, I don't care, it is not the standard for any other TR game so why mess with it. Oh, I know, because they couldn't care less about their original, loyal fan base, they want to cash in on the new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money. Pathetic.<br /><br />My advice to any serious TR fan is keep away from this game, and if you do buy it complain to Eidos. I have seen masses of other posts, mainly on the Eidos forums, from people telling them how rubbish it is, perhaps they will listen.",movie

138,"Aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence, this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours.<br /><br />It starts with an interminably long intro where the Leeds family is introduced, including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely clich√©d Pa and Ma, and incredibly annoying Grandpa (played by Charles ""Chic"" Sales). While sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street. The mobsters flee through the family's house, leaving them as witnesses to the crime.<br /><br />The rest of the movie consists of Walter Huston as the crusading DA occasionally interrupting long anti-crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob. It all winds up in a predictable manner.<br /><br />Good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating, Nat Pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the gorgeous Sue Blane in a small role as the Leeds daughter. <br /><br />If you want to watch Huston play his early trademark crusading lawman, try 1932's ""Beast of the City.""

145,"This is just dreadful. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this dreck. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but I don't remember laughing much, except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors.<br /><br />An unattractive middle-aged man called Lester meets up with rich unattractive middle-aged women via lonely hearts ads, and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. That's the whole plot, and that's really all that happens. Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret, but its so badly implemented, you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening. The sequences in which Lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies. One sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven. It's very cruelly depicted, but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music, with Lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout. Another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs...you have to see this to believe it! Actually - you don't have to see it at all, in fact I strongly recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career. One sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched: the revelation when Lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen, so from this point on he just films the actor as normal, shadow and all!! And thus totally blows the whole angle. Either he had zero budget for effects, or he just didn't care enough to think up any way of showing it. Whatever it was, that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is. I couldn't even understand most of the film, and there certainly wasn't anything on screen worth looking at half the time. Even the ending was as flat as a pancake. A real dud.",movie

151,"When I first saw that the Dalai Lama had written books I knew that I had to read them.I have a huge amount of respect for this man.The first book I have read by the Dalai Lama is ""How to See Yourself As You Really Are"".It is a book on Buddhism, about realizing how we exist and the interdependency in which we live.I haven't read much about Buddhism before, not more than we were forced to in school, but what I learned in this book was a great place to start, it was in many ways a beginners guide to finding the clarity Buddhists are after.Everything is dependentPeople and things don't inherently exist; we exist as the result of many different things working together. Just look for example at a table, we often see it as one thing, existing in and of itself, but it is really just a sum of parts and it only exists because someone put it together.Just like our body is just the result of many cells working together who in turn are built by many molecules.The whole mindset teaches you to calm negative emotions by going to their root, by understanding cause and effect and that things aren't independent but instead interdependent.I understand why people become BuddhistsThe whole way of life of a Buddhist is very intriguing. Learning to control your mind, to feel love to all around and continuously improving yourself.I plan on reading a lot more about Buddhism in the future, as I plan to read about all the major religions.The lessons we can learn from religion is both important and enlightening, as long as we read with a combination of openness and a willing to find the underlying lesson, not taking everything for absolute truth.The question markWhen I read the Dalai Lamas book he many times discusses the ""I"", what is it? It is not our body, since we say ""my body"", it is not the mind since we also say ""my mind"". It isn't the mind + body since that would mean that they are one and the same, which they aren't.The problem is that I never got an answer to this question in the book.As a Christian I would answer, the ""I"" is the soul. It is the soul that is something other than the body and mind, something we cannot find, measure or understand.But I still wonder what a Buddhist considers the ""I"", what is it that gathers Karma and gets reborn?The answer wasn't in the book.I encourage you to read this bookSince reading ""How to See Yourself As You Really Are"" I have learned to take better control over my emotions and have a better understanding for myself and for others.I deeply encourage you to read this book, it holds many valuable lessons and a viewpoint not often encountered in western society, a view point worth listening to.",book

154,"This is one of my favorite books in my library (I have a 2000 book library). It presents a very unique perspective on wealth, it's a personal growth book, not a ""how to"" investment book. I own many how to books also, especially on the subjects of finance and investments, but none of those even hold a candle to this book. I found the exercises to be very helpful towards the end of this book. I copied and pasted some of my notes from this book below in the hopes that it will give you a sense of this book:""Abundance can be defined as having more than what we need and want.There are two ways to go about becoming abundant: The first is to get all you can, then get some more, then more, then more, and then some more, and then more, and all of it as quickly as possible and before everyone else...The second is to reduce your levels of wanting and needing.The fundamental problem with the first approach is this: there is simply too much our imaginations can desire and by the time we're close to getting something, our minds are usually already off wanting something else. This ability to want more than we can ever possibly get gives people a feeling of perpetual longing- of never being abundant.If you desire many things, many things will seem few.Is the solution then to want nothing? Not really. The critics of ""desiring desirelessness"" have said that ""the scheme of supplying our wants by lopping off desires is like cutting off our feet, when all we want are shoes.""The workable approach to abundant living lies neither in trying to obtain everything nor in wanting nothing. Rather, it is found in this: Amongst all our wants, if we choose what we really desire, and pursue that dream with a passion, we begin to live a life filled with happiness.Put another way: you can have anything you want, but you can't have everything you want.We have enough resources to live any dream we want to- but not every dream we want to. There is enough sand to gather to build foundations under our castles in the air, but not enough to build vacation castles around the globe. Knowing this and choosing well holds the key to achieving a life of wealth.A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.Wealth as defined by a dream is attainable; wealth as defined by vain fancies is always beyond reach.We must select the illusion which appeals to our temperament and embrace it with passion, if we want to be happy.Money, in and of itself, is nothing more than a means for facilitating trade between men. For example, if we were chicken farmers and we wanted to trade for cows, a cow farmer might not want chickens, he might want apples. In order to get his cows, we would then have to find an apple grower who wanted chickens, trade him our chickens for apples, then trade the cow farmer apples for cows. The system of money saves us from having to lug chickens all over town and allows us to trade with people who have no interest in our commodity. Money is modern society's means for facilitating trade between men. It is not an ends, but a means. It is not an end of life, but an instrument of life. Money is a means for facilitating the dreams which fulfill our lives; it is not an ends to sacrifice our lives to.Wealth is found in the fulfillment of a dream, not in the accumulation of money in the hope that it will make us happy.Unhappiness is not knowing what we want, and killing ourselves to get it.No amount of material possession produces happiness. Fulfilling our heart's desire is what brings us a sense of happiness.Happiness depends less on exterior things than most people would assume. People often look for happiness in the possession of the external- in money, a good time, somebody to lean on, and so on. They are impatient, hurried, and fretful because they do not find happiness where they look for it.The happiness of our lives depends on ourselves. - AristotleHappiness is something that depends not on position, but on disposition, and life is what you make it.If our character is such that we have not yet learned to appreciate anything, then no matter what we obtain or how much we change our external environment, within a short time we return to the same unhappy state in the new life as in the old.I would rather be able to appreciate things I can not have than to have things I am not able to appreciate.So much depends on how we see things: some people see the treasures in the chest; others measure how much more room there is in the chest for additional treasures. For the former, life is charmed. For the latter, they're never happy until the chest is overflowing- at which point they begin to complain that the chest isn't big enough.Next to excellence, is the appreciation of it.The distinction between happiness and joy is this: joy can only be found within where happiness is the direct side effect of fulfilling a dream. Hence, where the keys to experiencing joy lay within ourselves; the key to experiencing happiness lay in creating the external prosperity necessary to the realization and sustenance of our dream.There are two things to aim at in life: First, to get what you want; and after that, to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second.As a tool for pursuing and obtaining the dream we seek, prosperity is wonderful. However, when we work solely for the purpose of accumulating more- we leave the course of our dreams. Working merely to get by or merely to accumulate more money is the equivalent of living in a perpetual state of slavery.Man must choose whether to be rich in things or in the freedom to use them.""",book

With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who don't take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story is actually paid attention to, which kind of shocked me; I assumed the whole purpose with these ultra-low-budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story, but they use lots of words like ""technological"" and ""physicality"" in the script to get their point across. (Although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there's so few cast members.) Nobody cares about this stupid storyline, and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft-core homoeroticisms (which aren't all that edgy). I would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with a TV-quality look and acting level. There are a few ""sexy"" scenes that are alright -- the boys writhing in bed in their boxers, feeling themselves up; or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them -- and some of them are kinda funny.

The lady owner then told me that for our order it would be another 15 mins. 45 mins passed before we receive our crawfish. No seasoning, no plates, no napkins. We had to throw our own crawfish. No service.

159,"Miracles on Maple Hill by Virginia Sorenson is a great book. If you have ever believed that miracles could happen,this is the book for you. Marly is a ten year old girl that lives in the city with her mother, father, and older brother. In the spring of one year her family decides to go to her great gandmother's home on Maple Hill. While Marly is at Maple Hill, she meets some remarkable people. Some of them are Mr. Chris, Crissie Chris, and Harry the Hermit. They are all wonderful people and Marly grows to be close friends with each of them. Marly likes Mr. Chris the best, though. Mr. Chris tells Marly that if she looked hard enough, miracles would occur each weekend that she was there. The first miracle was making sugar. Other miracles happen along the way. I really enjoyed this book and you will too!!! This is a MUST read book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",book

It has all the solutions in the back which is awesome and the solutions manual covers every type of problem presented in the book, although it does bounce randomly about. This book isn't great though because it doesn't cover all topics fully, especially graphing some of the D.E.'s. The majority of the content is solid and easy to follow. Time is spent equally between logic and doing examples.

What's more, it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way, not pulling any punches in what it shows, yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter. it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema, and deserves a place amongst the canon of 'different' horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on). It's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema.",movie

167,"What ""Noise"" fails to do is get us to understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer, particularly car alarms. It's an odd idea for a film, which has about as much creative credibility as ""Death Wish."" It is clever at points; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through Hagel, ""I'm too stupid to be understanding this."" He reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and don't get it either.Just then a car alarm goes off. Throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises. Though, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona. <br /><br />The film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing, and visible boom mikes. No, ""Noise"" isn't all-bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the ending doesn't fall flat. Overall it drives home a logistical point, one you haven't probably thought of. At least I hadn't. Though all in all, ninety minutes long, it couldn't have ended sooner. The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.<br /><br />This is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival, but probably won't get picked up for distribution.

How many? How many? How many? Ha! You do not answer that so quick. I make better questions than you answers, hmm?"" (pages 58-59)This is Mrs. Anna Leonowens (an English governess's) first introduction to the eccentric 59-year-old King of Siam, King Mongkut, in the 1860s. Margaret Landon's `Anna and the King of Siam' is an intriguing, historical tale based on ancient, Siamese records and the secret diaries, letters, and conversations of Anna in Bangkok that reads like fiction but is amazingly genuine [some parts]. Anna, along with her six-year-old-son Louis, embark on an erratic odyssey through a foreign land of a cryptic culture that will, in a few months, become traditional to them. Yet there are some seemingly barbaric issues to be cleared up. Among them are slavery, the King's concubines in the harem, and the unjust treatment of several subjects. While Anna may have altercations with the King, she comes to revere his intellectual methods of attempting to create Siam a scientific nation in modern times but expresses severe criticism on needless occasions. As a governess, her duties are to instruct the royal children (of which there are more than 67; however, only the eldest participate) and aid the King in composing extraordinary letters to renowned world leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria. Prince Chulalongkorn, Anna's most prominent and smartest pupil, is heir to the throne on account of being the eldest; she attempts to steer him onto the positive path of ruling the country justly. Also bestowing color to Anna's experiences, including misadventures, other than irrelevant talks with the King on that of Moses and ethics is a cast of supporting characters: Tuptim (the slave), Lady Thiang (the King's head wife), Lady Son Klin, and countless others. Across Anna's remembrances, a message is conveyed: despite one's differences they must master the skill of understanding the outsiders and point them to salvation, excluding falsehood by supplanting it with truthfulness. 'Anna and the King of Siam' is a fascinating web of Siam's (now Thailand's) superb past filled with rich descriptions for a journey neither the reader or Anna will let sink into oblivion even until the breaking end. --P.J.

169,"Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series). The cast had chemistry, and they seemed to genuinely like each other. That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have. It also made many of their best stories into great western drama.<br /><br />Like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season, there are bound to be some weak ones. However, most of the time each episode had an interesting story, some kind of conflict, and a resolution that usually did not include violence. While Bonanza was a western, the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction. While I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; those shows usually ended with a gunfight. Gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict, and Bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing.<br /><br />In the early years of Bonanza, there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights. Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series, but they are pretty good in and of themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, Guy Williams was brought in to replace him. Williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay one more year, and thus Williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams had stayed on for the duration of Bonanza, one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965, when Pernell Whitaker left the show.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, once Pernell Whitaker left the series, the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks. Whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes, and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid, and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, that did not leave too much room for any gunfights.<br /><br />At some point they hired a ranch hand called Candy (David Canary) who became their fourth member of the cast, but Candy was never featured in any gunfights, and he was hardly more than an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two they also had Ben take in some other lost cousin (Jamie, played by the forgettable Mitch Vogel) who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone.<br /><br />Apparently by adding the teenager, the studio was looking to attract younger viewers. It also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, delinquency, etc. Those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter-culture movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV, though Hawaii 5-0, The F.B.I. and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing TV shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief, mayhem, and crime.<br /><br />The addition of a teenager to the cast gave the Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems, but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general. After Dan Blocker died, the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled. The last season was pretty bad, as it featured Little Joe tracking down the killers of his wife, and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife, and how unfair it was that she was killed.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever seen the last episode of the series, and I wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way. By the last year, there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) actually living on the Ponderosa, as Adam had moved away (and never came back even once as a guest) and Hoss had died and Little Joe had left after his wife (in the series) had been killed by drifters.<br /><br />Overall, the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left, it slowly declined. Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too. By 1970, the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical, and it had lost a lot of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show, and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the 465 episodes that were produced, at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama! That is a pretty good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows.",movie

172,"I like films that don't provide the typical ""happy ending,"" and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are arrested in Thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the Thai authorities. The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether (or which) of the girls was involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer. Jacqueline Kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind, magnanimous wife, Yon, who is also an attorney. I wish the girls had been abused more in the prison, as another commenter has suggested, as I've heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. Where this film grabs me, however, is its ending. Alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that Darlene can be pardoned, and we (the viewers) realize that they are both innocent. Any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me, and this well-acted drama is certainly deserving.",movie

Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King...even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

The film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the film's length is a bit short. In addition, it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel, which would be very interesting as well. So grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this one.",movie

When people talk about Pacino and Cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances? A story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and deceit. The two actors gel amazingly well together, and the supports from Aiello and Fonda are equally as impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers run to press. Instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery, The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted.",movie

185,"This book is probably the best known full-length satire of society. In it, Swift mocks what he feels to be the all the iniquities of the 18th century. And of course, it's far from being a children's book.There are four voyages and only the first two are known in the popular imagination. In each voyage, Gulliver goes to a country/countries that are radically different from those known and stays with the court/government learning about the country and sometimes helping out.Part 1 is a voyage to Lilliput. Here, the people are very very small. This is the most well-known part, containing famous satires such as that of the Big-Endians and Little-Endians. The small characters generally satirise the characteristic of pettiness.Part 2 is a voyage to Brobdingnag. Here, the people are very large. As such, they satirise the opposite quality - that of being overbearing. Here, Gulliver is paraded as a pet.Part 3 is a voyage to Laputa (and other islands including Japan). Here, Swift mocks scholarship and science. Each of the several islands has a peculiar trait to do with science. Here, you'll find such classics as the novel-writing machine and the country where the linguists decided that words are too indirect to communicate being signs of signs so everyone carries a large sack of objects to point to in direct communication - which sounds like something from a modern academic, except this is interesting.Part 4 is a voyage to the country of the Huyhnhnms. Here, Swift departs from tongue-and-cheek and becomes biting. The country is a utopia populated by benevolent horses and the humanoids are wild and uncivilised so they're &quot;looked after&quot;. As a result of the horses' brilliance, Gulliver becomes disgusted with the human race after seeing the difference. Obviously like all parts of the satire this is not to be taken literally - that Swift despised people.That's the basic content but nothing can describe the joy, humour, wit and imagination used in the book. It has everything and is an absolute must for anyone who's ever saw something funny/wrong with society (ie. all).",book

His descriptions are not long or labored but carefully crafted and succinct and pierce directly to the heart of the matter like those of a very skillful songwriter. They are not used merely to impress or create a flowery prose; instead, they transcend the ordinary to the level of extraordinary and enhance character and the themes of fate, love's destructive and healing powers, and man's futile struggle to comprehend and control both fate and love. Williams' storytelling engulfs the reader and pulls him in to the tumultuous sea of love, much like the strong undertow of the North Atlantic does to the inhabitants of this little Irish island.

189,"I'm probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy ""Frisk,"" the project that put Todd Verow on the map, if that is indeed where he is. I appreciated that someone had the guts to take on Dennis Cooper and not back away from the material; Verow fairly rolls around in it. Judging from what he's done since then he's well-suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it. ""Vacationland,"" a would-be ""teen coming out"" film, is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy, and I'm disappointed I have to report that.<br /><br />First off, our hero, the high school Senior ""Joe"" is far too old in appearance to be playing 18 . When we later meet a man who is supposed to be Joe's teacher it's confusing, as the sweaty-faced guy looks much younger than the student he's teaching. Joe's mother looks younger than he does and doesn't ""act"" any older either. Second, in Joe's opening scenes he looked like he was either playing, or actually experiencing, mental challenges. To his credit he got better as the film went on and I figured out he was ""playing young,"" but it just wasn't working--it was weird.<br /><br />It's 15 minutes in before anything is revealed about who, what and where these people are, and why we should care. The second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men's toilet room that, considering where the story goes later, is absolutely superfluous; the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all, even as a ""rite of passage"" for our ""young"" hero...one minute Joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex (a scene so un-erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice), the next minute he's an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double-crossing. This is followed by an extended scene with the character we'll later learn is ""Andrew,"" and that's about all we learn about him, other than he's apparently gay but not out yet.<br /><br />There's a lot crammed in to the 1:44 running time (which is about 20 minutes too long--I can't imagine how it played with the mind-numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of Joe walking around); a sub-plot copped from ""Gods And Monsters"" with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously can't remember his lines (he is conveniently dispatched with in a way Dickens might have come up with on a slow week); a mix-n-match almost-four-way between the boys and their girlfriends, a gay-bashing toilet tramp, a would-be wise sage in the form of a nellie queen (and hasn't the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the ""hooker with the heart of gold"" as most tired stereo-type?) who exists only to be degraded; blackmail, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording.<br /><br />What you will NOT find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots; we're expected to imagine we're in an airport, grocery store office and classroom, as all the scenes in these locations consist of close-ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford. One thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar; either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in Bangor, Maine, as the bar never has any patrons in it. Another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn't coming from the speakers, but was just more of the droning loop-music of the ""score.""<br /><br />Plots and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable and the dialog, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is ""film-speak,"" meaning no humans actually talk this way. Since we aren't given any information about these characters it's impossible to care about what happens to them; it's as if Joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll (certainly the character of Joe's sister, a wannabee Jennifer Grey who is Bohemia-crazy, seems to just simply ""stop,"" we never know where she is in LA or what her problem is...but again...does it matter?). Visually the film looks very good at times, more a testament to new developments in hi-def video than anything, I suspect. The editing is pretty clunky though (there was one great edit; Joe is posing naked and says, ""I wanted to play sports, but..."" and we cut to a shot revealing his ""butt..."" ha ha). Composition is also odd at times (I thought I was watching SCTV's parody of ""Persona"" when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene!).<br /><br />One senses Verow is really restraining himself from making a ""naughtier"" or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does, and maybe he shouldn't have held back (the frothy toothpaste/sex fantasy worked nicely, I thought, though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie)...he produces and directs this ""sensitive coming of age"" story much like Herschell Gordon Lewis directed films without gore...porn films without sex in them. I got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasn't boring, it just wasn't very good either.",movie

I was amazed at how in some situations she stayed calm or didn't do what everyone else was doing. For example, when Nia, Passion and Tyanna did extasy and had their own menage a trois, she did not participate, instead she observed. She became quit smart.

It's hard to go wrong with freshmade pasta, and the carbonara I had was good - nicely al dente bucatini with generous amounts of pancetta and pecorino topped with an egg, at a fair price point ($11).  I know lots of folks have problems with the pricing of Italian food when they eat out, but Grassa seems to balance the quality and price well in general.  

I was tempted to order a negroni or a campari and soda, but as it was already 8 and a work night (and coming from drinks with coworkers), I passed.  

In any case, super excited to have this option a few blocks from where I live.",restaurant
197,"First I will detail the faults of this book. It is too brief. Mr. Asimov was working under the assumption that he had to keep it under a certain length, and so abbreviated it unfairly, cutting certain amounts of plot and character development.That aside, this book is excellent, showing the struggle against adversity and brains versus brute force that is so lacking in most modern literature. It is true that Science Fiction is the Modern version of Romantic (the time period) literature, and Asimov carried the beacon.",book
198,"Probably one of his lesser known films, it suffers from the same lack of exposure as Salvador in that its actually one of his best.<br /><br />Written by and starring Eric Bogosian, Talk Radio tells the story of an opinionated radio phone-in host who upsets the wrong kind of listener. The film is important, and has much to say on the issues of free speech and just how free it should be, and you can easily tell that it started life as a stage play. Know what you're getting into before you sit down to watch it and you'll be fine.<br /><br />There isn't much to the acting really as Bogosian pretty much steals the film, he wrote and is given licence to rant, I couldn't take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination many of the listeners had; the people who hated him wouldn't turn off in-case they missed something.<br /><br />Not for everyone, but a very good drama and overall a very good film.",movie
199,"This movie probably isn't the funniest I've ever seen, and it CERTAINLY doesn't have much redeeming value. In fact, it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot. However, this ""make-it-up-as-I-go-along"" attitude actually works to the film's advantage. ""Tommy Boy"" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the SNL skits Farley and Spade starred in succeeded: their well-timed extemporaneous silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their immaturity.",movie

201,"Many Americans find Mann's analytical prose to be a bit on the tedious side, and indeed, there are some passages here that could have been shortened. But part of Mann's genius was his ability to capture every last detail, and this is one of his best. The unique take on Dr. Faustus blends Schopenhauer with tha ancient morality tale, and even focuses on human obsession with the great. Take a few weeks, and find yourself engrossed in Mann's astonishing prose",book
202,"I went to see this film at the cinema on the strength of its potentially interesting subject matter, good cast, a director who had previously done the highly-rated ""Once Were Warriors"" and my liking for noir-ish films set in L.A. in the Forties and Fifties. I would argue that I am reasonably easy to please in this film category; I appreciate the classics of the genre but I will sit through and enjoy a half-decent if derivative effort as well. However, I found this film completely unbearable.<br /><br />Despite a good situation in which to place the story, nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the whole two-hours plus of this sorry mess. Good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing. The narrative is slack and drags unbearably, and none of the events it depicts is handled well enough to do anything other than bore the audience to death. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value and by the end I simply didn't care what happened because I did not believe in anything in the film.<br /><br />L.A. Confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more true-to-life, the latter film deservedly gets all the plaudits for its excellence in every department. Mulholland Falls by contrast fails in every department, a fact made all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved. If they ever show this on a plane I will still walk out.",movie
203,"I happened upon this movie as an 8-10 year old on a cold, dark November afternoon. I was outside playing all day, freezing, and when I came in around 4pm, I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasn't all happy and silly--and was in fact dark, and moralistic. It captured my imagination. I'm sure it misses the text, and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist. But it still captures the spirit of the story, the choice to carry a burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfish, rash decisions, etc. The quality of animation leaves room for complaint. But the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations. John Hurt is great in this. If you don't like how the character is drawn, look away, and just listen to him. His voice is extraordinary. I've seen it again many, many times and it always brings me back to that time, as a kid, thirsty for some magical adventure. It's for this reason I say 'lucky', the film is nostalgic for me so I overlook its shortcomings. But between John Hurt, and Tolkien's fantasy, it still reached me, and still does.",movie
204,As a Czech I am very pleased when I read these comments here. I am absolutely sure that this film is great. And what you maybe don't know is that story was specially written for Mr. Brodsk√Ω.

205,"Well, there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller. Usually they are derivative or too ambitious, often they feature a conspiracy that is totally paranoic and unbelievable. But City Hall does not do neither of the above mentioned. The plot is cleverly crafted, story is believable. As far as characters go I would say this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays.",movie

208,"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles. Immune to reality, Betty arrives in L.A. and becomes ""Nurse Betty"" as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, the angered Charlie and Wesley track Betty down, convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with Del.<br /><br />Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting its main character's extreme innocence and optimism with the evident hypocrisy and violence that surround her. By clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life, Nurse Betty justifies its character's tendency to turn away from reality. Thus, while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film, Nurse Betty also makes a comment regarding the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities. In addition, Nurse Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its protagonist's mental state, particularly in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between ""Dr. David Ravell"", the character, and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays him. Betty's incapacity to recognize George as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings, which stress the magnitude of her delusional state. However, in spite of these successes, Nurse Betty suffers from the troubling characterizations through which the narration evolves. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced. Similarly, although the initial scenes establish Del as a detestable man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers surpass all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife Betty.<br /><br />Finally, toward the end of the film, Charlie undergoes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for Betty; an obsession which results in noble feelings of love, and which ultimately destroys him. Consequently, since the characters' roles as victims lack consistency, the story's victimization processes seem random and unsubstantial. All in all, Nurse Betty's indeterminacy --rather than creating suspense-- weakens its characters and pollutes its plot.<br /><br />",movie
209,"The Other Boleyn Girl was a favorite of mine to read because it not only provided me with rich historical references, it was a great storyline told from the point of view of a woman who was not held in the limelight. Rather, Mary Boleyn was an unassuming girl, trying to find her way in the courts of high society, used as a pawn by her parents. It was remarkable seeing the story through the eyes of a bystander.I enjoyed the rich themes of love and loyalty, the contrast between deceit and honor. It made for a thorough read, an interesting tale. The love between the siblings is juxtaposed with their simultaneous violent rivalry. Amidst the brutality, this tale is a story about ambition. Ambition for the Boleyn family in the time of King Henry's court.Read if you love historical fiction. The story gets lengthy and somewhat repetitive towards the middle, but is still an amazing novel.",book
210,"This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him. This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. This movie starts out with Lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home. This movie also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.",movie
211,"I saw the premier of this movie during the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival and was very impressed with the skill Director, Jeff Hare, exhibited in bringing this timely topic to the screen. The cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed us to examine the issue of a senior wishing to die on ""his own terms"" in a very warm and humorous way. Peter Falk was brilliant as Morris and the supporting group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles. The interaction of the family, friends and outsiders with Morris created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes to die with dignity.<br /><br />Although this movie is ostensibly a movie about a Jewish Actor and his family, it is truly a movie about all families. The jokes the family and Morris crack during this romp through the life of a ""Force of Nature"" are fresh and realistic. Childhood rivalries, adult successes and failures, and hope for the children are integral to this screenplay. While many will question how you can make the topic of suicide ""humorous"", I thought the treatment logical and timely. If you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a family struggling with this issue, then you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />The movie was awarded ""Best Picture"" at the Phoenix Film Festival.",movie

216,"The words ""Swedish"" and ""Action movie"" do not mix. That becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre. This is yet another failed attempt.<br /><br />Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems. One day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesn't do what they tell him. They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it.<br /><br />This movie has it's ups and downs. And usually in Swedish action movies there are no ""ups"", just ""downs"". So i guess something in this movie showed some quality. To begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made. The footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice. The acting is of very varying quality. Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (i wonder how long Swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank?). Stefan Sauk is laughable as the ""cool"" special forces man who comes to the base to investigate.<br /><br />And what about the action scenes? Well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice. But aside from that there is not much action to talk about. And that is a common problem with Swedish action films. There is just not enough action going on. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's film-making culture. I don't know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because quite frankly, the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that.<br /><br />I rate this 4/10 for effort.",movie

God only knows what drove the likes of Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick, but I really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes. The story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids, leading another group to go after them. The pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring. The plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this, and no doubt done much better. The obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesn't manage to overcome this at any point. This really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel. Extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended!",movie

A very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers, all of them just at about the same psychologically stages. Many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age & our first feelings about sexual relations. it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism, but even in that case she doesn't corrupt the likelihood of the story. You can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere. I fund the young actresses of talent, special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressing!",movie

I am able to understand more about the elements & modes and how the signs came to be and the planets under the signs are insightful. But, you only get keywords - which is difficult for a student like me to jump from looking at the chart and make a cohesive interpretation like my returns or transits. So, if you want a raw foundation of what the signs, planets, and aspects mean, this is a great start. But, if you want in-depth interpretation of the planet in a sign/house and the aspects between each other, this is not the book you want. A sidenote: even though it is keywords, it is accurate (granted that the chart is accurate to begin with). You would need an online or computer program to create the chart, but they do list a service that generates the chart for you and how you go about in reading it.",book

The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie up all the loose ends. Unfortunately, it didn't.

The animation and voice acting were great, but with an idiotic plot, dull setting (most of the movie doesn't even take place in dull WWII Earth rather than the Alchemy world), and disappointing ending (Ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy, and he ditches Winry?), it was altogether pretty lackluster.

Obviously shot for television or STV, this amateurish rehash KRULL has several stock characters -- a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist -- on the trail of something or other in order to defeat the Dark Forces about to be unleashed on their planet. Badly written, acted and staged in available California locations like municipal parks and a ranch, LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend it, not even as a time waster. Jay Underwood is the only ""name"" actor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five year olds, are not likely to remember him from such ancient Disney fare as NOT QUITE HUMAN. A no-name actor playing a magician in an ill-fitting silver wig at least plays it with tongue planted firmly in cheek, while those around him act as if they are in a dinner theater production of KING LEAR. I was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence. Alas, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old fashioned painted-over cartoon gags we used to see in 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks, like Bert Gordon's THE MAGIC SWORD. The filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully never came to be. Often, such cheap Hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors.

What good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place. As if people would not go on to kill this dangerous threatening monsters when they are not getting paid.<br /><br />Needless to say that the story for ""The Quick and the Undead"" is far from a tight one. It of course also isn't being filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialog.<br /><br />Still it's not a completely horrible movie. It certainly ain't as bad as some people try to make you believe it is. It's a rather good looking one, or rather said the movie at least doesn't have a cheap look over it. It's effects may be a bit overused but nevertheless they are quite good looking, as are the make-up effects as well.<br /><br />Still the movie was not what I hoped of it. Its title might suggest that the movie is set in the wild, wild west, during the days of the cowboys but its title is just a misleading one, no doubt picked to cash in on it. I fell for it, expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a gory zombie-horror-flick.<br /><br />For the fans of the zombie movies this movie will mostly be a disappointment to watch.

236,"The over-heated plot of ""Bonjour tristesse"" is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan, which became a best-seller, though God knows why. For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal. Don't be taken in by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the step-mother-in- prospect. Unfortunately, too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg. She's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's St. Joan -- Seberg's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film. This movie, also by Preminger, fulfills the ""promise"" of the first. It was her second movie; she was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of acting capacity? Not a chance? Seberg's character is at the center of the story and, pretty though she is, convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old, she can't meet the emotional demands of the role. I don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures. But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check. In spite of Niven and Kerr, this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons.",movie

I had the rare beef pho which came with a generous portion of beef and noodles. A bowl of pho was around $13 which is on the expensive side for pho but at least it was good and so was the service.

243,"On the positive side: &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; has some breezy, sharp dialogue; some of the descriptions are well done; and, structurally, it is mildly interesting, although largely whimsical (e.g., the changes in paragraph justification). On the negative side: the symbolism is awful; there are many bland and/or trite descriptions (e.g., &quot;leaden skies&quot;); it is bloated with overworked, competing, confusing, and clumsy modifiers (i.e., adjectives and adverbs); the characterization is thin, and it is executed in a series of disjoint and amateurish character sketches; the narrative tells too much, while showing and evoking too little; and, the ending is just plain silly.In &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;, Morrison's characters are superficial and pigeonholed. It seems obvious that Morrison approached the story with ideas, rather than images (just read the afterword), and then forced her characters to act out these simplistic ideas. Here Morrison is too preoccupied with social, psychological, and moral messages; and, her characters and situations are contrived to provide didactic illustrations of overdrawn generalizations. Because of this, the reader's attention is pulled away from the characters as unique and complex creations, and focused on the messages, or &quot;lessons&quot;, the characters are intended to help convey. Just read other people's reviews and this is obvious; many reviewers identify with Pecola only as a young black woman in the abstract, and urge others to read this book because of the &quot;issues&quot; it raises. This is evidence of both inartistic writing and unimaginative reading.Morrison's symbolism is abstract and artificial. Particularly bad is her use of blue eyes to symbolize `a cultural conception of beauty' or `stereotypical beauty'. An artistic, or poetic, use of symbolism should be image-oriented, evocative, and the symbol should embody the essence of what is being symbolized. Blue eyes are a poor symbol for `cultural ideals of beauty' because blue eyes do not provide a compelling and instinctual image of such a thing; and, because blue eyes purport to symbolize an abstract and intellectual concept, as opposed to a concrete image or quality. That is why this overreaching symbolism must be spelled out explicitly in the book. When you picture blue eyes do they immediately and instinctively evoke a sense of `cultural ideals of beauty'? Of course not. These connections must be manufactured. As bad as the symbolism of blue eyes is, Pecola's desire for them reduces this symbolism to a ridiculous allegory.Another complaint I have is that Morrison never withholds an image. Everything is graphically described and, therefore, the images become confused, overwrought, and numbing. Sometimes the best way to get across the sense of an image is to hold it back and work around it with more powerful, definite, and effective images. The incestuous child rape is a good example of where it would have been better to cleverly work with the reader's imagination but shield the actual act from view, letting the reader experience the situation rather than react to it. In being so explicit, Morrison conveys the facts, but not a heightened and controlled sense of the events. The images lose their power to evoke because they are so uniformly morbid, overdone, unfamiliar, and evidentiary. It is sometimes said that such unswervingly bleak portrayals are &quot;true to life&quot; and &quot;real&quot;---which invariably leads to their discussion in real-world terms. But these situations are not real---they are unbalanced, unimaginative, concocted, and phony.To end on a positive note, here is my favorite passage from the book: &quot;When you ask them where they are from, they tilt their heads and say `Mobile' and you think you've been kissed. They say `Aiken' and you see a white butterfly glance off a fence with a torn wing. They say `Nagadoches' and you want to say `Yes, I will'.&quot; This is pretty good stuff.",book
244,"i was disappointed in this documentary.i thought it would be about the second chess match between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player.Kasparov was and still is,considered the greatest chess player ever.the movie takes us back to 1997 where Kasporov had agreed to have a rematch with ""deep Blue"" after defeating it 1 year earlier.but instead of focusing on the game,it focuses more on what happens before and after.there are snippets of the game,but not very many.much of the film centers around Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly.the movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way.they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place.who cares?i also found it very dry and slow.ultimately this movie was unsatisfying.this is just my opinion,of course.if you like conspiracy theories,this movie might interest you.for people not into chess or conspiracy theories,this movie would probably have no value.i am a chess fan,and i only stuck it out because of that.i give""Game Over:Kasparov and the Machine"" 4/10",movie

247,"Like a lot of Western fans of Asian cooking, I never am quite sure if what I'm eating in a restaurant is the real, authentic cooking of a regions, or an overly Westernized version. Korean food has not been homoginized to the extent that Chinese and Thai food have in this country, but unless you're dining with a Korean-born companion you can never know for sure. The same goes for cookbooks; is this the real recipe someone would serve in their home in Korea, or something that's been homoginized to a MacDonld's-trained palatte?I bought ""Eating Korean"" after reading reviews both here at Amazon and at a few on-line bulletin boards for Korean expats and Korean-Americans. The general concensus was that while the recipes were toned down a bit in seasoning, they are indeed authentic. So far, my experience has been that carefully following the recipes in Celia Hae-Jin Lee's book will deliver something very close to what I've had in various restaurants. I've made her seafood pancakes (Pa Jun), kimchee pancakes, and various namool, and all have come out very close to what I expected.Unlike some cookbooks for non-western cuisines, no special cookware or difficult techniques are required for most of the recipes presented here. A large pot and a skillet or wok should suffice for most any recipe. Grilled meats like Bulgogi can be made on a barbecue grill. You might want to buy a traditional bowl for serving the hot BiBimBop, or some large mason jars for making Kimchee, but that's about it.Aside from the recipes, the author's stories of growing up Korean in Korea and America are very enjoyable, and provide a context for the recipes; I was greatly reminded of another favorite cookbook, ""Every Grain of Rice: A Taste of Our Chinese Childhood in America"", which, although about Chinese and not Korean cooking, has a similar narrative structure.",book

I was thinking medieval based on the title, and I was not expecting near distant future at all. Nevertheless as I read it, I was drawn into it, fascinated and unable to put it down. The use of color was astounding and phenomenal, with red, blue, green, and black representing different class and social positions. I actually felt like I knew what it was like to live as a handmaiden with a white head-dress on, sneaking glances from inside of it. The world created is astounding, vivid, and partly horrifying. Beautifully written, it seems plausible, like it could actually happen and that is why it is slightly terrifying. Human nature is put underneath extreme circumstances--a world in which many women are infertile--and the outcome of handmaidens used as concubines to produce children is an appropriate, realistic outcome. It makes me appreciate the society that we live in. I would highly recommend this book.",book

252,"Depressing black BLACK comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) who flees her house on Christmas Eve when she discovers her husband (Tony Goldwyn) has hired a hit man to kill her. She ends up with a husband and wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go wrong. Basically Farrow keeps running and is continuously meeting VERY strange people and getting into morbidly unfunny situations.<br /><br />This was advertised as a feel good movie when I saw it around Christmas time at its VERY short run in an art cinema.

To make matters worse Eileen Brennan is thrown in as a nun (!!!) later on and proceeds to chew the scenery with gusto.<br /><br />The only saving grace was Farrow's acting--it's much better than this picture deserves.

255,"*BE WARNED OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br /><br />A friend told me to check out this series, and I'm glad I took her words for it.<br /><br />I read the synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately intrigued. The main protagonist is Muslim? No way, this is a first! It's about an FBI agent who is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in LA; and get this - he is a practicing Muslim. I was a little skeptical at first, half-expecting some hero or the antagonist to spout maybe silly, gratuitous and mindless holier-than-thou fanatic drivels... let's face it, a lot of shows have been guilty of this.<br /><br />But then I watched the first three episodes, and I thought: Okay, this is good. It wasn't until episode four (""Scholar"") when I was well and truly impressed. I would like to commend on the great writing and also, superb performances from the actors. I just love how complex every one of these characters - they're not straight out two-dimensional cardboard cutout good guys/bad guys. Michael Ealy gives a wonderful and believable performance as the Muslim FBI agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed, treading the fine line between being the good Muslim and being a man with flaws. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth - Farik is not the typical oily Middle Eastern stereotype, but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesn't see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs. He's very charismatic and authoritative. But I would say that it was Alex Nesic's performance that clearly left an impression in me in ""Scholar"". His portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was amazing - torn between the softly spoken words of a Muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the non-aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in God's eye and Farik's persuasion to believe otherwise.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to watch more shows like this, and not some ridiculously high-octane one man show series.

It shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide etc etc. I always knew what was going to happen before it did but I was never bored. What I found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers aren't much different than American teens. They had many of the same difficulties and hang-ups. Also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and (I heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it.

267,"""Ulysses"" has the reputation of being unreadable - or readable only for literature students and professors - but also of being the most influential work in 20th literature. The latter might be true, because most books written afterwards have somehow used the stream-of-consciousness-technique and the non-linear storytelling. Mostly, the book is really about language and its relation to the modern world. Joyce wanted to use a different approach to language to make it consistent with the increasing complexity of every-day-life in a big city. I think that even modern movie experiments such as David Lynchs ""Mulholland Drive"" go back to Joyce' ideas to really dig deep in the complicated psyche of an individual, for which traditional storytelling is not sufficient.But is it really unreadable? The book certainly needs some preparation and some effort from your side, more than most other books. But once you are well prepared, the Ulysses is actually well readable, and at most time even a lot of fun. And often you do not wonder why it was heavily criticized at the time it came out. For example, most of modern literature which uses a lot of profanity and vulgarity looks like children books when compared to the Circe-chapter, a sado-masochistic fantasy of the protagonist. Joyce' language skill makes this chapter breathtaking, a pure adventure.At other times, the book is a pure delight, for example ""Wandering Rocks"" or ""Penelope"". If you listen to your intuition, even the latter (which is the most legendary chapter of the ""Ulysses"") is not difficult to read. But then, there are also parts where Joyce' experiment with language fails: For example the ""Oxen of the Sun"" is just bothersome and really unreadable.As I said, the book is only fun if you are well prepared for it. You should definitely read Joyce ""Dubliners"" first, which is an easy to read collection of short stories. It introduces some of the characters which return in the ""Ulysses"", and this gives you helpful background information. Even more important, read ""Portrait of the Artist"", which is a portrait of Steven as a young man. He has a main role in ""Ulysses"", and ""Portrait"" already introduces a lot of the central ideas of Steven and ""Ulysses"" in general.Other books which are comparable in style and intention but easier to read are Virginia Woolfs' ""Miss Delloway"" and John Dos Passos' ""Manhattan Transfer"", definitely two books which warm you up for the idea of ""stream of consciousness"".All in all, Ulysses is an experiment with language which is a lot of fun, but which does not work for all parts of the book.",book

270,"Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb.<br /><br />At first, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. At the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India. At a refugee center, you see the lady about to give birth--after which the titles to the film finally are revealed.<br /><br />The entire focus of the film then changes completely--to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras, India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family. None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing--what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film. Somehow or another, she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad #2--though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parents.<br /><br />Soon after this, the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film), as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused. Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way, the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother. Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents (particularly the adoptive mother) was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a very, very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants, off and on, for three decades. The family's decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble, but also a bit stupid at times--as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents--first you tell her she ISN'T your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE!!! Sure, the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother, but this really was stupid in hind sight. If it were me, I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid--thus avoiding being in the middle of a war!<br /><br />Despite my complaints, the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding. Far from perfect, it sure hits an emotional home run. Also, while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films, many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where--this IS standard in most films from India--including those made in Bollywood (Bombay) and Tamilwood/Kollywood (Madras).",movie

273,"This is a novel so beautifully written that it transcends into literature. Ingenious in its conception and carefully crafted, the author has created a unique and dazzling work of fiction. Divided into three parts, the book tells the story of a most unusual life, that of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.The first part of the book establishes that he was born to a woman who was hung from a gibbet for having left him to die. It turns out that Jean-Baptiste is an unusual baby. He gives people the willies, because, unlike most babies, Jean-Baptiste has no scent.Over time, Jean-Baptiste develops into a boy with a secret gift. His olfactory sense is developed to a degree unheard of in humans. He delights in parsing the odors around him. Ugly, friendless, and a loner, he eventually ventures into the city of Paris, a malodorous and pungent cornucopia of smells. Believe me, there is plenty to sniff out in eighteenth century Paris! Jean-Baptiste savors each whiff, and the book conveys these olfactory delights with meticulous, descriptive precision.His bleak existence is transformed, however, when he one day captures a heady scent of such exquisite beauty that he finds himself obsessed with it. Determined to have that scent at all costs, he eventually sniffs it out. It turns out to be the scent of a young virgin on the cusp of flowering into a woman. It is a scent that he must possess. What he does to do so will surely chill the reader.Jean-Baptiste eventually maneuvers to get himself apprenticed to a perfumer, so that he can have the opportunity to learn the trade and create scents. He leads a bleak existence, subsisting as little more than a slave to the perfumer for whom he works.The second part of the book begins when Jean-Baptiste leave his employer and goes on a personal pilgrimage, leading an austere existence away from civilization for many years. There, he withdraws into himself even further, living a totally self-sustaining, hermitic existence. He ultimately realizes what other have sensed about him. Jean-Baptiste has no personal scent. He simply does not smell.With this knowledge, he returns to civilization where, having lived as practically an animal for many years, he creates a fictitious and adventurous scenario to account for his filthy and disgusting appearance. Subsequently, he is taken under the wing of some local nobility and feted and pampered. Realizing the importance of scent, he creates a personal scent for himself. He now realizes that he who has the power over scent can rule supreme. He intends to do so.The third part of the book has Jean-Baptiste migrating to a town that is the hub for the scent trade. Perfumes, oils, and soaps are the stock in trade for this town and, as such, beckon brightly to Jean-Baptiste. Once there, he again smells a scent so delectable that he longs to possess it. He knows that scent for what it is and now knows that it is the scent, and not the personal charms of its bearer, that captures the attention and devotion of others. Jean Baptiste wants to harness that scent at all costs. He desperately desires the power to make others love him. He wants to be supreme.It is his desperate desire to harness and possess that celestial scent that causes Jean-Baptiste, a socio-path with little empathy for others, to prey upon the maidens of the town in order to obtain that which he needs. It is his obsession that lays at the heart of the vortex that arises in the town, as murder after murder occurs. Yet, no one suspects him.

275,"I can not describe how painful this book was. The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl. This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the ""excitement"" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children.",book
276,"This movie is juxtaposition of various super bad tough guy biker characters, loosely connected but with no real storyline. Some of the scenes are nicely filmed. If they took the same cast and crew, and made a movie called the Gent who was the coolest character in the film and came up with an interesting and continuous story maybe it could be decent. As it is, prepare for a lame series of tough guy character intros, all of whom do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause trouble while all staying never getting sunburned and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never needing to look for a home or money, etc. There was a sort of background story about the characters pasts various people that were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot.",movie

281,"* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant<br /><br />WARNING *MINOR SPOILERS*<br /><br />Homosexuality these day's is hardly the taboo subject it was over forty years ago.However it must be said that perhaps more so in America than say, over here in the U.K. it can still be a touchy subject.Just look at the whole debacle of gay's in the millitary some years ago in the US.It's with 'In and Out' that writer Paul Rudnick taps in to the small town mentality of middle America and the way the press in the US (As well as in the UK) make such a big deal in outing a celebrity.You need only look at when Will Young and Stephen Gately of Boyzone came out of the closet.<br /><br />The movie centres on Howard Brackett(Kevin Kline), a High school English teacher in his home town.The local people are preparing themselves for Oscar night as one of the nominees Cameron Drake(Matt Dillon) came from their town and was a former pupil of Howards. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a vietnam epic wins the award only to out Howard as being gay during his acceptance speech.This could not come at a worse time for Howard who is just day's away from marrying his fiance and fellow school teacher Emily(Joan Cusack).As you would expect the media reaction is cataclysmic and turn's Howards life upside down.Not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay but evade sleazy news reporter, Peter Malloy(Tom Selleck).<br /><br />Although this was billed as a screwball comedy it's clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also attempting to be satirical.You only have to look at the early scenes at the Oscars cerimonee and the way the people of Bracketts home town as well as the teaching board of the school react to his outing.<br /><br />Sadly the film doesn't live up to the promise we see early on in the movie.This is a pretty flat attempt to make social commentary out of a wacky comedy.A good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never really delivers the nessecary amount of laughs and is no where near as insightful as it thinks it.<br /><br />Kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance that he gave us in his earlier comedy 'Dave', making Howard an instantly likeable character. Cusack too is good value as Howard's weight obsessed fiance while Tom Selleck play's very well against type as a gay news reporter.Bob Newhart is a joy also, as the principal of the high school where Howard works.It's great to see him on the big screen for a change.It's a shame that it had to be this.<br /><br />The performances as good as they are can do little to rescue the movie from being a rather dull affair.While a couple of scenes do offer some amusement.Namely the inspired scene where Howard attempts to make himself seem more manly by listening to a self help tape.There is little to enjoy, and when things can't seem to get any worse Rudnick resorts to a sickening finale that lurches in to over the top sentiment. I also couldn't help but feel that my intelligence was being insulted.Malloy appears to be too sleazy a character to become the man who put's his ethics before getting a good story while Cammeron finally come to the rescue in the film's climax seems at first to be too self involved a character to care a jot about what happens to his former teacher.After all it's he who caused all the trouble in the first place.<br /><br />'In and Out' isn't exactly dire.But when you consider the likes of Klines better work like 'A Fish called Wanda' you can't help but feel that here is a great talent being sadly wasted.<br /><br />Robs Rating:* *",movie
282,"I have in the past loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the head-cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless.",movie

You need to feel things are spiraling out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters who you care about, and you don't have that.

286,"Not that ""a film by Ulli Lommel"" filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects, which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the ""mockumentary"" style, because it never looks like anything other than video. Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. It does not feel like watching a movie. And what's even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He ought to know better. He ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video. For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. And lucky us, he wrote the script too! So you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied. Please, please miss this film.

There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son.

Garcia was an original Western settler, arriving in Montana in 1878, one year after the famous Nez Perce Chief Joseph's surrender. If you want authentic Old West, here it is. Garcia tells it like he saw it, favoring neither Native Americans or Europeans. He marries three Indian women (sequentially) and leaves his past world behind.

291,"This book is a great read for anyone who's ever had the desire to just chuck it all and head for the woods (a desire that seems to wax and wane like the tides, popular one decade [1970s, for example], totally passe the next). Today taking to the woods for many means building a $500,000 ""rustic retreat"" with pool, hot tub, and wine cellar included. For Louise Rich, back in the 1930s (the book was published in 1942), things were much different.For one thing, her house had no plumbing. Water had to be hauled to the house in buckets. Supplies and the mail came by boat. Life was no picnic for her and her family. But, of course, there were trade offs. The beauty of the place, for one. The living as one with nature. The need to be resourceful, and the feeling of pride and accomplishment that goes with it. Trade offs worth the hardships, Rich makes perfectly clear.Rich captures the flavor of her idyllic spot in the Maine woods a few miles east of Upton along the Rapid River (the swiftest river east of the Mississippi, even though it is only about four miles long). She describes what life is like there, how the busy summers are a prelude to the slow, long winters. She talks about her neighbors, the loggers, the animals they encounter, how one endures and enjoys life in the woods. She describes the effects of the hurricane of 1938 and the havoc is caused even there, so far inland. Her prose style is clear and direct, and she truly makes the reader jealous of her situation rather than sympathetic. It's an excellent book, one that I've read a number of times, always with an I-wish-I-was-there enthusiasm. Highly recommended.",book

295,"Any person considering reading PERSUASION by Jane Austen must have several thoughts in mind before beginning. This book is a classic, written by a master. It requires an investment of your time, your patience, your understanding and your attention. It is a book to be savored, not galloped through as if it were a modern fiction bodice ripper. If you are willing to approach this book with an open mind, expecting only to receive pleasure from the written word, you will most likely enjoy it tremendously.I read a lot of modern romance fiction. One of the things I have noticed on researching a book through the Amazon review system before I buy it is that so often reviewers state that they were able to finish the book in two hours, three hours, four hours. Do they honestly think that is a compliment to the author? One thing I can guarantee here, you will never be able to say that about PERSUASION. Slow down, read for pleasure, read for the pure joy of observing Jane Austen's manner of combining words. Her punctuation style is totally different from modern fiction. It requires that you hold thoughts in your mind long enough for her to have completed her lengthy and complicated sentence structure.Fans of Jane Austen often say that one specific book is their favorite. My favorite is the one I happen to be reading at the time. I've read them all multiple times and am always able to find nuggets of pleasure either not noticed before or now understood from a fresh perspective. PERSUASION is a book which shows very clearly Miss Austen's feelings on the English class system and how appearances are very often deceiving. Anne Elliot's own family is (in their minds at least) in the top strata of society. In actual fact, they are very small fish in a wide pond and do not amount to much except when within their own corner of England. Anne spends much time with the Musgrove family and all those surrounding that happy, boisterous group. Although lower in the social standings, they are loving, kind and generous, traits which are totally lacking in her own father and older sister. Anne is considered of no consequence to her family yet is loved and admired by those outside her social set who can see her value and worth. This is a story of young love lost with the opportunity to reclaim that love when maturity has given new insights into reasons, details and personalities. This book does not specifically leave you with a ""happily ever after"" feeling. Anne will never be mistress of Kellynch-hall, probably never even live there again. Captain Wentworth is a career naval officer with all that implies in his future service during wars. And yet, you cannot help but feel that Anne and Frederick will be quietly, calmly, gloriously happy for their remaining days. Partially because of the eight long years of separation which allowed them both to mature and grow and partially because they are just so very right for each other.Do not begin reading this book expecting a ""romance"" novel as written today. If you do, you are doomed to be disappointed.",book

I found myself rooting for Bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. Every time he blew one of them away I felt good. This movie does not take itself seriously, but what if it did? There is a good build-up to the fireworks finale in which Bronson goes on a rampage. But as far as acting and plot go, it just doesn't measure up. If I lived in that neighborhood, I would get out as fast as I could, but it seems like the people are asking for trouble. I know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. I had to give it a 4. Sure there are good ""blow 'em away"" scenes but that's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64. I'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this movie. This movie gives you a sense of rejoice. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To sum it up, this is far from being the original Death Wish, but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up.",movie
298,"For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to bring his friend Jascha Heifetz to the screen. One evening when Goldwyn and his wife Frances were having dinner with Heifetz and his wife, silent screen star Florence Vidor, Goldwyn proposed that Heifetz star in a movie. After some persuasion, Heifetz agreed, on the condition that his acting be kept to a minimum. And the movie, originally titled ""Music School"" was born.<br /><br />The story itself is rather stock: A streetwise boy (Gene Reynolds, who is best known as the producer of ""M*A*S*H""), runs away from home and ends up at a financially troubled music school run by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). While attempting to raise funds for the school, the boy and some other kids happen across Heifetz at Carnegie Hall. After much ado, Heifetz ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school. <br /><br />The story, while predictable,is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several minor gaffes where different scenes were patched together, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room on an errand and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later.<br /><br />What is not surprising is how good the acting is. As was customary for studios then, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (later of Ma and Pa Kettle fame), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, and a Who's Who of character actors. Actress Diana Lynn and singer/actress Kaye Connor made their (uncredited) debuts in this film, as did longtime Nelson Eddy singing partner Gale Sherwood (as Jacqueline Nash). Child veteran actors Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn also appear.<br /><br />Goldwyn hired the Peter Meremblum Symphony, a highly regarded youth orchestra from the Los Angeles Area, to appear in the film. Most of the kids in the orchestra weren't actors, but they were excellent musicians, as good as professionals (which many of them later became). Many of the kids in the orchestra went on to noteworthy careers: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn both starred in the theater and movies, Richard Berres was a producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known music supply company, Elliott Rapaport went on to be a prominent cardiologist, Lewis Elias was a band leader, Thomas Facey a conductor with different symphonies, Channing Robbins a prominent instructor at the Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins an instructor witn SUNY Stonybrook, and many of the kids in the orchestra pursued musical careers with major symphony orchestras.<br /><br />While Heifetz's acting was kept to a minimum, his salary wasn't. He commanded $70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be re-shot at a later date, he got an additional $50,000 for another four weeks. What thankfully wasn't kept to a minimum was his musical output. Composer Alfred Neumann (who was once a Meremblum Orchestra conductor) handled the scoring. Heifetz performs the ""Introductionne and Rondo Capriccioso"" by Camille Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of Manuel Ponce's ""Estrellita"" (with an off-screen Teddy Saidenberg accompanying), Dinicu's devilishly difficult ""Hora Staccato"" (from a Vitaphone recording, with Emanuel Bay at the piano), an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's ""Melody"", an excerpt arranged for violin solo from Tchaikovsky's well-known ""Adante Cantabile"" from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the movie), and the final movement from Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody's E Minor Violin Concerto. During all of these performances, there are many closeups of Heifetz's performing, including some very close shots of his fingering and bowing, something that would be of value to violinists desiring to study his technique.<br /><br />The Meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing the arias ""Caro Nome"" by Verdi and ""Casta Diva"" by Bellini, (both with Sherwood singing ), an arrangement of the overture from Rossini's ""Barber of Seville"", a short excerpt from Mozart's ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"", and the previously-mentioned Mendelssohn concerto (with Heifetz). Diana Lynn can be heard in the background of one scene, performing part of Chopin's Nocturne in B-flat Minor, and a five year old Mary Ruth performs Chopin's popular ""Minute"" Waltz.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent movie. AMC showed this regularly up until early 1992. I haven't seen it on television in recent years, but copies of it are not difficult to obtain. If you have the chance, I highly recommend that you view the movie.",movie
299,"I finished Blue Highways approximately 2 weeks ago.Never having even heard of William Least Heat-Moon before, I purchased this book based on Amazon recommendations. My only reference point was that I enjoy travel books.Initially I was a little backed off by the sheer length, and I wondered if the author would be able to hold my attention. It was, therefore, with trepidation that I dipped into Blue Highways.I needn't have been concerned. Yes, the book was long (and occasionally I had to re-read a handful of really detailed paragraphs), but William Least Heat-Moon was able to transport me to many of the tiny towns he visited, and I could feel the often intense discomfort of living for a season in his trusted Goast Dancing. I have true respect for this gentleman! The photographs were a wonderful addition and it was nice to put faces to names.I agree that on occasion he was maybe a little overly critical of &quot;modern&quot; life, as some other reviewers have noted, but his opinion is simply own. I didn't feel he was trying to sway the reader; he was stating facts that he felt were significant, and let the reader digest them and form an opinion of his/her own.In short, I would thoroughly recommend this book. The writing is clever, witty and detailed, and reading Blue Highways will take you on a fascinating journey. I have River Horse ready and waiting as well as PrairyErth!",book
300,"There are two kinds of 1950s musicals. First you have the glossy MGM productions with big names and great music. And then you have the minor league with a less famous cast, less famous music and second rate directors. 'The Girl Can't Help It' belongs to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her... well, never mind. Seems like every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one can't help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie.

It is so difficult for them to get past the differences of today's age and then; however, hopefully some will have inspiring teachers who will be able to get them through the details enough in order to see the universal story of perseverance and strength of family.This book is not a page turner, has dated dialogue and writing style, and is probably not for everyone.

Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor my own age - died today. It kinda reminded me of many lessons I have learned in my life.

There is no need for more words.<br /><br />The play of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is superb. I have seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was certain that they are good actors and in case of Eric I always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother. This time this certainty is raised to fact, no question. His play, just as well as the play of Mr. Edwards is clearly the top of all their profession.<br /><br />I recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your DVD shelves.",movie

It is easily the most thorough and up-to-date reference covering the full range of geophytes.One of the features I like best in this book is the short, easy to read and well-diagrammed Botany and Classification of Bulbs chapter. It is a very well written introduction that includes explanations of the jargon and theories used by taxonomists and horticulturists. This is a great intro for early students of horticulture to grasp the bigger picture.The majority of the book is an A-Z, with accompanying line drawings as well as hundreds of color images. Each entry covers the family, culture, pests and disease, propagation, and all relevant species. The use of the new family classification is appreciated, with a handy reference to the previous family in parenthesis.Speaking of families, there is a great explanation of all the families of bulbous plants in Appendix A. Appendix B has all the bulbs around the world listed by country of habitat. The list of flowering time is not particularly useful though becuase it only breaks down into the 4 seasons. Early, mid, and late season classifications would be nice. There is a short list of plants for specific purposes - fragrance, cutting, etc. There is a very thorough bibliography and a common name index.This is a large and heavy book, but worth every penny.

Commercials for it made it look quirky and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Sadly, I was terribly disappointed with Nurse Betty.<br /><br />Personally, I've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together, and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully, in my opinion, are Tarantino and the Coens. There isn't that much violence in Nurse Betty, but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when I was supposed to laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where I was being asked to.<br /><br />The film doesn't much work as a drama, either. Renee Zellweger's Betty, the story's protagonist, is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way. I will say Zellweger acts the role quite well, and Freeman, Rock, and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs too. The problem is in the writing; Freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character. It's really too bad. 3/10",movie

313,"That is to say, only medium well done. The cover blurbs of the copy I have make much of how 'horrifying' and 'brilliant' this book is, going so far as to compare it to Umberto Eco. I find it to be closer to the work of, say, Susan Kay.Don't get me wrong, this book is entertaining. The concept of the scent-master is (as far as I know) quite original, and the theme is carried out consistently throughout the book. The author has a sharp eye for detail and is not afraid to stray from his plot for an interesting digression, which is always nice to see (myself, I would that he had more discretion in deciding what subjects qualified as 'interesting' but that is a matter of taste.)However, the characterization of the mass murderer as an amoral, asocial creature with delusions of grandeur is frankly overdone. It belongs in a Johnny the Homicidal Maniac comic. Worse, the author can never quite seem to decide how much irony he wants to lay on, sometimes seeming embarassingly earnest, other times plunging his story into ridiculousness with a wink (Ok, we get it! Everyone who interacts with your main character is going to come to a bad end! How clever.)As for the supposedly shocking and horrifying nature of this book, a heap of corpses does not true horror make. By refusing to allow any empathy for any of his doomed characters, the author may be trying to force us to take the point of view of his sociopathic protagonist, but in reality, he dries up the source of most of the potential emotional impact of the final chapters. The climax and finale are rushed, abrupt, and present a barely-surmountable temptation to skip ahead to the last page.The overall impression I was left with was that the author studied so hard to be unsentimental that he fell over the edge into reverse sentimentality, a sort of simpering affection for nasty occurances not coupled with any real insight.",book
314,"Brown's is a food truck (as opposed to a brick-and-mortar restaurant); if you're wise enough to head for it, you won't run into parking problems, or excessive wait times (except maybe on game days).  What you WILL get is some of the best BBQ that Austin has to offer!

The brisket they make here is my hands-down favorite; it's got just the right amount of smoke, and it's so tender that a fork is all you'll need to eat it :-)

While the brisket is my favorite, you really can't go wrong with anything they make here.  Their pulled pork is a Thing of Beauty, and their North Carolina style BBQ sauce is really excellent.  I also really enjoyed the sausage on my brisket and sausage sandwich, and their coleslaw is REALLY good.

315,"&quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; is a story about a girl named Faith, who has long since left her hometown in the state of Minnesota, and is now based out of Los Angeles. She is a world-traveling culinary writer currently visiting Italy for an article, when she gets a phone call from her younger sister Skye back in Minnesota. It seems Skye has gotten herself into trouble once again and desperately wants Faith to come home. (Home as in Minnesota, not Los Angeles). Skye's husband has left her, she is pregnant, and the bar that they co-own is in financial trouble. Faith at first is adamant about not wanting to go home for various reasons, but after a couple of terse phone calls (one from Faith's own ex, who can't stand her but really thinks she needs to get back to Minnesota to help her sister), Faith gives in. Upon returning to Los Angeles, she packs her stuff up and takes a road trip to Minnesota.Thus begins Faith's adventure. She vows to save her sister, save the bar, and reconcile with (or just avoid entirely) her ex-boyfriend Flynn. But of course things don't quite go the way she plans. Her ex, who had proposed to Faith before she'd fled town with another guy ten years previously, seems to not be able to take being in the same room with her. Her scatter-brained yet lovable sister Skye is desperate to get her life together, but can't seem to pick a decent guy or show up for work on time. Worse yet, certain financial circumstances force Faith and Flynn to spend a lot of time together. When it becomes apparent that there is still a lot of sparks between herself and Flynn, Faith realizes she must come to terms with why she ran off in the first place, and whether she still has feelings for him. (Feelings other than physical, that is!) Will she be able to find herself, help her sister, and save the bar from financial ruin? Will her sister get her act together? These and many other questions will be answered when you read this book.&quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; mixes together a perfect recipe of romantic suspense, sisterly love, friendship, exciting plot twists, and wonderfully flawed characters for a delightful read. The main character Faith is very funny and real, and I often found myself laughing out loud at some of the things she says. The other characters, while all possessing various flaws, come across as very likeable and realistic. You'll find yourself rooting for them even through all of the mistakes they make!The plot of &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; was flawlessly executed, stubbornly holding my attention until the very end. Pretty much from page one, things start happening at a fast pace. Beth Kendrick does an excellent job at both keeping the reader informed about what happened in the characters' pasts, and moving things along in the present.Many readers will be able to identify with the main character, because she is just so down-to-earth and funny.Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who loves a good story.

316,"It shouldn't be necessary to read this book given how overwhelming the evidence is but Posner brought it all together in a way that hadn't been accomplished before. Not only is it absolutely convincing but one is almost disappointed that there isn't more to it. Well, I guess that is THE reason conspiracy theorists continue to soldier on.All of the ballistic and physical evidence is airtight, but perhaps a little dry, so here's what I find convincing beyond that evidence:--The more specific a conspiracy theory becomes, the more awry it goes, and the bigger laughingstock the author becomes. The single shooter explanation may not answer every single question one has, but it stands up to all challenges--A great point Posner made: if witnesses were being killed, why were no conspiracy buffs ever killed? After all, they were doing substantial 'research',naming virtually every powerful individual alive at the time as conspirators. Why not? Because it was all completely irrelevant.--Oswald was a ""patsy""? let's look at his actions that day: He goes and stays at Marina's on a Thursday night for the very first time. Why? Because he had to pick up his gun from the garage. The next day he leaves almost all of his money and their wedding ring for Marina. Pretty strange coincidence. He then carries a package he termed 'curtain rods' on the very day when a gun was taken to the Depository to kill the president. Pretty amazing coincidence. After the assassination he, alone among Depository workers, leaves the scene (and within minutes of the assassination-I guess he found the matter humdrum) and goes back to his room and gets a gun. He then (we'll assume the 'innocent man DIDN'T kill officer Tippett) sneaks into a cinema without paying and when approached by a policeman attempts to shoot him (the gun misfired). Just another day in the life of Lee Harvey?--The 'magic' bullet was placed on a stretcher by a conspirator? Why would he place a bullet when all the autopsy and ballistic information was going to be faked anyway? Or, if it's not faked, why would he place a minimally-damaged bullet when the investigation could prove it NOT to be the one, and obvious evidence of a conspiracy?There's so much more and you'll find it all here. I strongly recommend this book.",book

When ordering there were two lines but people were cutting over and crossing over without much organization. The menu was on a magnetic sheet with magnets indicating prices, descriptions, and calories. Problem with this was that kids would move them around and everything was pretty jumbled, making it difficult to see the correct pricing.

320,"Without Kirsten Miller this project needn't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be.

321,"OK, so I gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months, i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool....little did i know that the only cool thing about this clich√©-driven turd was precisely its trailer.<br /><br />At the cinema, i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself ""no way this movie is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you've only seen 3 minutes"" while i rolled my eyes in shame. All those frames showed....get this....a guy with a poker face (because he feels nothing....that's deep) looking straight at the camera in the middle of the frame. In the second or third one, he stays awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead guy...cause he feels nothing), and his father calls, and says ""John Garden State, is me, your father""....oh come on! I've seen a little more than a couple flicks to hate clich√©s such as the ""is me, your (insert parent)"", how the hell am I supposed to react??: ""Oh, he has a tough relationship with him""....uh....yeah, thats exactly how I'm supposed to react....<br /><br />Man, this is a crappy movie...<br /><br />Anywho, as the flick goes on, we learn things about his friends, of which everyone is a ALTERNATIVE EMO WALKING INDIE MOVIE CLICH√â. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant who speaks Klingon (Bizarre characters + Pop culture = Your standard American indie flick). Then we know Natalie Portman's character, who is a copy of Alissa Jones (from a movie that kicks GS's butt, Chasing Amy), Amelie and that chick from Eternal Sunshine... you know, smart, original (not really), cultured, beautiful and...in touch with her sexuality (!). She listens some '70s band named The Shins and gives...what? they're from this damn decade?? Then why do they sound like that?? Oh, they have no personality, OK.....so she hands her CD player to John Garden State and he looks at her with a dumb face(you know, love). As the song played on, i heard its lyrics saying ""you will love this soundtrack, it is so alternative and cool, you will love this movie, it will define you and your generation even if it is a ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club, Ghost World and every other smart teen movie from the last 20 years, you will drink coffee and read books you don't understand""...<br /><br />By now, really unoriginal sh!t starts to happen....he doesn't care if he dies in a airplane crash (because he is already dead....and he feels nothing) and he lets us know in a scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB!!!, it is a cool scene but, oh, did I mentioned it appeared in the trailer?.......then in some party, and just when you think this guy is really deep and asexual he makes out with a bimbo....so oh, he's not such a emotional zombie after all....clever character development or just a sh!tty movie?......well, lets analyze that scene, it features him sitting motionless in a couch with everyone else moving in really fast speed......scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called REQUIEM FROM A DREAM!......so just a sh!tty, sh!tty movie...<br /><br />Then they meet more eccentric (clich√©, actually) characters, and finally, one that lives next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says some crap like ""good luck exploring your infinite abyss"" and the guy says....and by now i wanted to really choke myself, ""You too""..............and then we are gently told that Neo is Jesus....oh no, wait, thats from another dumb, obvious, repetitive, overestimated and clich√© piece of crap.<br /><br />Finally (Finally!!!!), some more crap happens and he enters the big warehouse showdown to defuse the bombs: he has to talk to his dad who he hasn't seen in the last zillion years cause he (FINALLY COOL SPOILERS) killed his own mom....(you see, he killed his mom, so he's also dead.......and feels nothing.....that's deep). Now I really expected just clever and moving Magnolia-like dialogue between a father and a son......but this is Garden State, so this is pretty much it: -John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you didn't know what you were doing when you drugged me for a zillion years, but I know you love me -Crappy director's dad: No!!! No!!!! I'm gonna say some simple stuff cause I'm not really so deep of a character anyway, like this whole movie actually, so no!!!! -John Garden State: No dad, we must get along cause we are equal individuals.....i mean different individuals -Crappy director's dad: No!!!!! No!!!!............OK, you convinced me. <br /><br />And he gets the girl (cause he's no longer dead, you know) and the movie ends and i go and eat a piece of chicken that makes my day....<br /><br />This made-for-trailer movie sucks",movie

329,"A film like Crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness- i.e. the recent film Crash- almost to shame. Not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intolerance-is-rotten more significantly (although I'd wager Crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this), but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with Crash. Maybe it's not really necessary to compare the two, as Crossfire is in its core all deep into the film-noir vein like its going out of style. It was interesting actually to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said on the DVD interview, where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower (on purpose) so that more could be spent on the actors, and the schedule went through at a very brisk, quick pace. But then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set-ups that it took a lot to do. Just for a small scene, like when Robert Mitchum's Keeely first goes in for questioning under the Captain Robert Young- the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite. That there are many other lighting set-ups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period. Just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell, the bars silhouetted against them, and see what I mean.<br /><br />But back to the substance part of the film- it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery, but one that we as the audience don't take long to figure on the answer. It's then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldn't be found in a common crime picture then, as there are really no 'criminals' for the most part in the film. There's a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the (worthwhile) message against anti-semitism. But Dmytryk's direction of his top-shelf cast, along with a really terrific script by John Paxton fleshes out the characters, least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message. And what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it? Mitchum helps that along, even in scenes like between him and Young where its very much based in the situation of the story's moment (i.e. a detail in the plot), by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog. It may already be there in the lines, but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenes.<br /><br />Then there's also Robert Ryan, who excels at Montgomery as a man who you know you don't like much at first, just through his b.s. demeanor, but you're not totally sure about either. Then once it starts to come clearer- ironically through a subjective view-point of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) at the apartment of the soon-to-be-deceased Samuels- his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind-way. It's a good performance when also countered with Cooper, who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility. It's really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this, however, and while you're watching the film it's more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes, and in the sometimes stark, overpowering camera moves on the actors, so the message is in a way secondary. Not that it isn't an important one, especially for the time period (coming right off of WW2), but years later its seeing the actors, even the ones that don't get the big marquee status like Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatale of the picture, if it could've had time for one which it doesn't) and William Phipps as Leroy (the ""hick""), working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplay.<br /><br />Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too, as for very long stretches we hear nothing, and mostly when it does come up it's incidental to the character's surroundings. He could've just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis, most specifically the opening audience-grabber into the film. By sticking clear of that, and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast, it uplifts standards in genre material to a very fine, memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant he tells to Leroy, where all such elements come into place well. It might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs- and I'd still throw-down Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in this kind of picture- but it's assuredly higher in quality than something of the B-level too.",movie

If it wasn't, then the director should never direct anything again. The effects in the film is laughable at best, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI-animated being added into the frames at a later date. The actors don't even look all that frightened when they see the thing (probably because they really don't, and they're just terrible actors).

She never knew when her dad might not come home when he is a guest of the state; in fact he is about to be released from Rahway. Her mom was murdered when she was nine though the person arrested had an airtight alibi. .Former NFL star and now lawyer Joe Franklin and Sister Catherine ""CC"" Christine hire The Genetic Testing laboratory to evaluate evidence that convicted David Falco of rape and murder ten years ago in the infamous Suicide-King case.

However, Billie begins to change her mind and for the first time wonders if the system has convicted the wrong person. Using new DNA testing to prove her new assertion, Billie is unaware that the true culprit is observing her progress; if she gets to close she will become the next victim.This is a terrific criminal investigation tale that will hook the audience with the work performed by Billie and Lewis. The case is a fabulous did he do it while the support cast enhances the plot as they either bring out the best and worst in Billie and Lewis or further the inquiries.

In 1959 the new Communist Chinese government forced the non-violent Tibetan Buddhist government, lead by the fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, to flee the land in preparation to overtake the Tibetan people. In his years in exile the Dalai Lama has written literature on the Tibetan Buddhist way of life, not only to attract the Buddhist population but the world's religions. This life is one of clarity, love, and good deeds. Path to Enlightenment, which is a commentary on the third Dalai Lama's Essence of Refined Gold, gives spiritual advice through the eyes of Buddhist over a span of many years, defining the life of a Tibetan Buddhist. The writing of Tenzin Gyatso and Sonam Gyatso together is showing us Buddha's principal on the path to enlightenment. ALong with defining the Lam Rim, which are the stages on the spiritual path.

Path to Enlightenment makes one aware of the steps that must be taken in advance for the true inner peace., while giving up the expectation of a quick fix to a problem. The Dalai Lama explains how to cultivate a person's own meditative concentration, to give the mind a clear state. A person has to train their mind to discipline themselves, but enlightenment is feasible by any human being.",book

It was a cinema verite of Betty hits the Beach encased for the first part by Mordant Morven. I really don't care what young lassies from Scotland do these days, who thy screw, what drugs they take. Visually, the stroll through the Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me. The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend. As the movie came to a close I had two thoughts... 1. That's all there is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed himself. Rename it. ""Bare Bitch Boredom, or What I did on my trip to Spain.""

346,"I just saw ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's ""there's something under the bed"" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you.<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED) I was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However, I think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like ""The Machinist"" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions.<br /><br />Here's my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of Su-Mi or the actual ghost of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and doesn't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be Su-Mi wiping her make-up in the mirror.<br /><br />I think the ghosts in the house aren't entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon or the mother or both. In the final flashback, it is revealed the Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink.<br /><br />The real stepmother, in the end, gets punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role.<br /><br />I wonder if the ""mother"" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous.<br /><br />Other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically.<br /><br />Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually Su-Mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and shouts, ""Don't touch me"" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the ""filthy things that you've done"" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the herky-jerky movements of Kayako in the Ju-On/The Grudge films. Also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others"".<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is ""Dark Water"" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.",movie

348,"We ordered take out for Sunday brunch, which we thought it would be crowded. It was not. 

We got:
The chicken tenders with black eyed peas and broccoli/cauliflower casserole. The chicken fingers are like fish and chip type of fried chicken tenders. They are beer battered which I was pleasantly surprised by! The portions were a little small though. The fingers were a little bigger than nuggets but definitely not your typical tender sized. Casserole was cheesy and delicious. Black eyed peas were tasty as well! The salt and seasoning they used helped. 

Rotisserie chicken fingers with Mac and cheese, and spinach. This was okay. Again, portions were a little smaller than I thought they would be. Mac and cheese was good. Tasted similar to the broccoli/cauliflower casserole except without carbs :). Spinach was, well spinach. 

Overall, good food with a little smaller sized portion. The staff was very friendly during my interaction which is definitely a big plus in my book. I'd say 8 Gryffindor points out of 10.",restaurant

351,"In baseball terms, Warren Goldstein's book is a walk, not a hit. It's good, but you always feel there was a more satisfying way to get to first base. As a fan of baseball and an avid reader of history, this book seemed like a natural fit for me, but while decent, there was also something missing.Covering the history of baseball up to 1876 (when the National League came into being), The History of Early Baseball follows the development of the sport from an amateur recreation to a professional competition. In the beginning (in the 1850s), the early versions of baseball were played by clubs who would occasionally compete with each other. There wasn't much rhyme or reason to which teams played each other or even the exact rules. The people who played were from all walks of life, and it was strictly a part-time activity.Eventually, however, the game got refined. Players started playing specific positions and the best players started representing the clubs. Eventually, to guarantee that such players wouldn't defect, money got into the equation. The transition from amateur recreation to professional sport was gradual but inevitable.The principal flaw with the book is that Goldstein writes as a historian, and this subject may be better covered by a sports writer. Goldstein is interested in the changing economics of the game and the struggle between the management and the players. This is a fine subject, but the result is that we lose some sense of the sport itself. We don't read much about particular players or teams or games; in addition, the different rules of the 19th century game are not discussed in depth (with the exception of the ""fly-ball rule""). Every baseball era has its stars, from Cap Anson to Ty Cobb to Babe Ruth to Ted Williams to Hank Aaron; certainly the early baseball era should have a couple, too, but Goldstein really doesn't discuss these people.Overall, I enjoyed this book, and many baseball fans will too. The problem I mentioned does not keep the book from being an interesting read, but it does prevent it from getting a five star rating. Nonetheless, this is a recommended read for fans of the game.",book

353,"Tru Calling was good but it could have been great. The concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that might have been explored in future. Unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show down.<br /><br />The writing wasn't too bad but there were holes. In episode 13, ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim. This was so toxic and killed so quickly the victim had no time to run or even scream for help. Yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer obtained such a powerful poison.<br /><br />In episode 15, ""The Getaway"", the off-duty policeman responded unrealistically. In the second diner scene he (meekly) tells the robber to drop the gun and when she doesn't follow the order, and in fact turns the gun in his direction, he allows it to turn into a standoff and then escalate into a hostage situation ¬ñ the very situation he'd been warned about. His response should (would) have been to shoot the robber when she failed to follow his order and upon her turning the gun on him. There are other faults in the stories but I'll leave it with these two examples. In spite of the writing faults I did like the show.<br /><br />The other problem I had was that I just could not accept Eliza Dushku in this roll. In my opinion she is too inexperienced and lightweight to carry this part. She never walked anywhere, she marched; and far too often she came to an abrupt stop on her mark. <br /><br />She also lacked any really emotional facial expression or intonation. She either has a pensive look or a cute smile; rarely are other emotions apparent. When she tries to appear dramatic she begins her line looking away and 'then' turns her eyes to her fellow actor. Or alternatively she begins her line looking at her opposite and then looks away. Both are annoying when done as a replacement for true emotion. An example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20, ""Two Weddings and a Funeral"", during her second wedding speech is devoid of emotion (eg. hearts in our hearts).<br /><br />I liked all of the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable. With improved writing and a lead change Tru Calling might have made it.",movie

357,"This book was so enjoyable! I think that anyone, young or older child, teen, or adult would love every page of it. I felt that it went by fast most of the time, but some parts were repeatable. I almost wish it were a little shorter, like each story only 100 pages so it would go by faster, but it was still very enjoyable. I actually have to say I like 'Through the Looking Glass' the best. I had always thought these were just short childrens books, I was surprised when I found out how big they were! I didn't really like the end of 'Through the Looking Glass' since it was about the same as the end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland'. The end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland' was better because: 1. I read it first, and 2. It was just better and I was very surprised by it (guess I haven't seen the movie ""Alice In Wonderland"" in a while!).

358,"Wonderful place to eat, no matter the size of your party. I was a group of 2 coming for lunch and we were seated immediately and served hot tea. They also gave us an extra pot of just hot water so that we could refill the teapot later, which was actually really nice.

To start, we ordered their Shanghai Dumplings (pork) and they were probably the best dang soup dumplings I've ever had in my life. They could give Din Tai Fung a run for their money, for sure.

Our second dish was the Braised Pork and Tripe Noodle in Soup; this was a real underdog in terms of taste and value. We were surprised at how good the noodles alone tasted (if you know the QQ quality, aka referring to the springy / bouncy / chewy texture of noodles, then this noodle had the best QQ of all the noodles I've slurped you before). Combined with the savory sauce and the satisfying chew of the braised pork, this dish was a real stunner at the table. We portioned the soup out into the provided bowls, which we were delighted to find were just the right size to cradle in one hand so that it felt like we were eating at home: bowl of food in one hand, chopsticks in the other, happily eating a damn good meal together.

Our final dish was steamed and thus took longer to make, but our waitress confirmed this detail with us at the beginning of the meal and we told her we could wait. The Sticky Rice with Ribs was a bit of a heavy way to end our lunch, and we had to take most of it to go with us but the bits we did eat were very tasty. If you love to munch on cartilage, this meal is perfect for you. Only point of improvement was that the edamame thrown on top of the dish could've been incorporated better, but I'd rather have them there than not.

All three dishes + tax and tip ran us less than $50 CAD, which was a total steal! We got great food, drank free tea, and enjoyed our experience here at Shanghai River a lot. Service was easy to flag down but they didn't check in too much; our experience was very efficient though, in terms of ordering, food delivery, and payment.

What I really enjoyed about this restaurant, other than the food, was the environment. All around the restaurant but at different tables, were families eating together, neighborhood grandmas catching up with each other, couples on dates, business lunches. The fact that this restaurant not only has good food but can promote themselves to be welcoming to all groups and occasions  proves to me that this is a restaurant that should be highly recommended and visited as a part of your exploration of Vancouver.",restaurant

360,"I would recommend you save your money and go elsewhere.  We dined at the restaurant on Saturday evening to celebrate a birthday.  We had a large party of 16 people.  Understandably it takes awhile to get the table ready.  The reservation was was for 7:30, so it only took a bit for us to be seated.  Once we were seated, that's when we should have known it wasn't going to go well.  Being a large party typically the server will either be focused on the one table or have a couple other servers help.  We had Alex and Mike.  We sit down, no menus and even had to ask for a set of plates/utensils for someone in our party.  We are asked what we want to drink.  I'm not sure since I have no menu.  When we finally get menus, we have to share.  What restaurant doesn't have enough menus for the table?  It wasn't until about an 1 1/2 hours into dinner that I was able to place my order for a glass of moscato.  I was brought a rancid, flat, drink that could not be drank.  When I told the server he came back to tell me they were all out of the wine.  How do you run out of wine, especially when it's the only one of that kind and it's Saturday? Our servers were gone, we rarely saw them and there was little follow up.  Probably because of the forced gratuity so he felt he didn't have to work.  Some of our party had watered down drinks that they had to server the drink separate from the ice.  Build your own drink I suppose.  We had to flag down Mike and one of our party asked about ordering and was cut of quickly and told ""that comes with dinner."" A little after 9 we were able to place our orders.  I received a salad soaked in dressing that was inedible.  They brought two baskets of bread for a party of 16? There should have been at least 3 or 4.  Dinner finally came around 10 pm (keep in mind we had a 7:30ish seating).  The horseradish tasted like 100% sour cream. One person ordered lamb chops to be greeted with what looked like lamb steaks.  My prime rib was 1/3 fat.  Overall it was way overpriced for the quality of the dining experience.  I don't think you should waste your money or time.",restaurant

Here is a quote from the book that really impacted me: ""Make and trust a blind idol, and you become blind (Psalm 135:15-18). Apply that principle to the modern world, and think of the idols of our own day. What do we make and what do we trust? Things. Toys. Technology. And so our hearts and our affections are formed by these things. They compress the void in our heart into shapes like toys. The result is that we are easily moved and excited by things-computers, cars, appliances, entertainment media. They seem to fit the shapes in our hearts. They feel good in the tiny spaces that have made. But in this readiness to receive pleasure from things, we are ill-shaped for Christ. He seems unreal, unattractive.

However, i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived, clich√©d, so-called ""message"" movies. <br /><br />The acting is mainly poor,(pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors...take note), the situations hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!), but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of. By the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation, making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one-dimensional players.<br /><br />Not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems. It's message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion. As for the films conclusion i found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and mildly offensive.

382,"I first read this book when I was 13, stumbling across it in a catalogue. And I remember that the minute I started on the first page, I couldn't put it down, and I re-read it many times. After that, I went to hunt for Kay's other book &quot;Legacy&quot;, which was also a very vivid book, but &quot;Phantom&quot; was the one that truly touched my heart. It has been 6 years since I've last read &quot;Phantom&quot;, and I can still remember the story very vividly, and how her works have inspired me to read up further on the history of Elizabeth and Erik. Up till now I find myself browsing for her works. Her captivating abiliy to put such life into a novel is extraordinary. I have not yet been able to find another author who can write as amazingly as she can. If anyone knows of another brilliant novel by her, please let me know! This book is definitely a must-read, and after that you'll find youself wanting more. Even if you re-read the novel numerous times, the story is always just as fresh as the first experience. This is definitely a book meant to be bought and kept.",book
383,"Overall I enjoyed the book. As pointed out in another review with a slightly lower rating, Scudder demonstrates his apathy towards a morally depraved criminal but unlike the other reviewer, I don't see this as a flaw in the book, rather as a flaw in the protaganist. In fact, the subplot is Scudder attempting to define his moral code, and in a very well written manner, seemingly panicing that he may not really have one.My only criticism is that I enjoy a bit quicker moving story. Personal preference is all, but why I didn't give it five stars.If you like the darker suspense genre with great character development, this is a must read.",book

385,"I love the futuristic setting that Ms. Lindsey has brought us through the Ly-San-Ter family. The barbarian society is fascinating to read about. However, this book falls short of being as good as &quot;Warrior's Woman&quot;.The beginning of the book is great; Dalden arriving on Earth and finds his lifemate. They then catch the bad guys in about the middle of the book.The rest of the book is Brittany's refusal to believe that everything Dalden tells her is the truth. She refuses to believe in the ship, the computer, the other barbarians, their planet, even their strange creatures have an explanation to her. It got VERY old after awhile.The more attractive plot to me would have been to have her disbelieve for a little while, then embrace it, and perhaps have a little more interaction with the &quot;bad guy&quot;. This &quot;bad guy&quot; is the same one who wanted Shanelle in &quot;Keeper of the Heart&quot;, and now he wants Brittany.How much more of an attractive plotline this would have been if Jorran kidnapped Brittany back to his own planet?! We could have seen Dalden chasing after her, perhaps rallying his planet to fight the Centurians to get her back. Perhaps that would have been a similar plot to &quot;Keeper of the Heart&quot;, but it would have been a much better page turner than the disbelief of Brittany to an almost painful level of &quot;what was she thinking?!&quot;This book started out with promise, but ended on a flat note. I give it a C-.",book
386,"TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all of Mary Pickford's films. At two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a ""greatest hits"" performance with bits of Mary the innocent, Mary the little devil, Mary the little mother, Mary the spitfire, Mary the romantic heroine, etc. characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past. The movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our Little Mary is thought the unwed mother in question! If the Academy Awards had been around in 1922, no doubt the Best Actress Oscar for the year would have been Mary's.",movie
387,"Smolin really delivers with this volume. It's pretty weighty, but the concepts are presented very neatly and without a lot of the technical jargon. The real strength of this book is Smolin's real objectivity when surveying the landscape of modern physics research. With all the hype over String Theory, it's nice to see someone take a step back from the giddying beauty and symmetries of the theory(ies) and provide a realistic assessment as to whether or not the theory has delivered. I think some of the best parts of this book are the last few chapters that deal with the sociological and philosophical aspects of science in general for the 21st century. Smolin's insights into the profession, particularly his critique for how new graduates are hired, given tenure, or research grants are pointed and disconcerting. Whether or not String Theory is the real deal, or the worst fad in physics since the aether, Smolin's approach to the subject is one that is well wroth embracing. The lesson that professionals and amateurs alike can take from this is never to put all your eggs in one basket. There've just been too many precedents of fundamental assumptions being overthrown in the past 300 years.",book

390,"This review is of Ivanhoe strictly as a fun FICTIONAL book to read. I can not vouch for any historical accuracy nor is that my intent.I turned onto Ivanhoe because I had heard that this story influenced Dumas when he wrote the Three Musketeer saga and I am really glad that I gave it a chance. The story of Ivanhoe is about the return of the Wilfred of Ivanhoe and King Richard from the Crusades. Wilfred is the disinherited son of Cedric of Rotherwood, aka Cedric the Saxon. Cedric dreams of restoring the Saxon monarchy and has been trying to facilitate a union between his ward, Rowena and Athelstane, whose pure bloodline would give credit to a claim for rule. A strong affection between Rowena and his son Wilfred (henceforth called Ivanhoe) has caused him to exile his son - his sacrifice to promote the Saxon cause. The disinherited Ivanhoe went to serve with Richard the Lion Heart in the Crusades. While Richard and Ivanhoe have been gone, Richard's brother, Prince John, has been gathering friends and making schemes for wresting control from Richard before he could get back and squelch his efforts. The conflict between the Normans and Saxons and the absence of King Richard (Lion Heart) has created the perfect conditions for a rebellion of the Saxons and/or a coup by John - both of which seem almost imminent.The twists and turns are great. When Richard and Ivanhoe return incognito and fight in a tournament, besting all of the strongest, the wheels start turning that will see damsels abducted, the storming and sacking of a castle with the aid of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, a witch trial and more swordplay. Great, great, great. It's no wonder that this work is still being read almost two hundred years later and influenced what I consider to be one of the best adventure stories ever - the Three Musketeers. If you like Dumas, you will more than likely like this even though it is not as involved or long as a Dumas novel.",book
391,"What can I say about Eva Peron that hasn't already been said? Her unparalleled power & beauty have become legendary and so has her bad reputation. Was she really as ruthless as her notoriety leads us to believe? It depends on who you ask and what you read.John Barnes biography has been translated to several languages and it has been re-issued several times but this is not an accurate biography of the enigmatic and now mythic Eva Peron. There are too many inaccuracies that just fuel the myths and Barnes' account reads more like a tabloid. It's a watered-down, less hateful version of Mary Main's ""The Woman with the Whip"". Both biographies are very similar in tone. The main difference between the two is that John Barnes does give Eva Peron credit for some of her accomplishments especially with her foundation. Main, on the other hand does not and she cites greed, hatred and megalomania as the reasons behind all of Eva's achievements. Main also accuses Evita of being personally responsible for the atrocities committed by the state police during the first Peronist period knowing full well that there isn't the slightest shred of evidence. She even states so in her book (""There is no proof""). John Barnes doesn't and for this I give him credit.One of my complaints with the newer versions of John Barnes' biography is that the epilogue is omitted. Those who are interested in purchasing this book are better off getting their hands on a good used copy of the original instead. The epilogue is interesting because despite the author's negative portrayal of Eva Peron, it clearly demonstrates that when all is said and done, the administrations that followed Peron and Evita were far worse. Even by the opposition's point of view. Barnes does a side by side comparison between Videla's chaotic Argentina of the 70's to Peron's less destructive and more popular form of government. He states that Peron may have had some of his enemies imprisoned but ""they all came out alive"". That is not the case with later Argentine administrations where thousands were systematically locked up, tortured and killed. Even children and the elderly were not safe.Having read countless biographies of Eva Peron in both Spanish and English, both pro and anti-Peronist, I can frankly state I know alot about Eva Peron including all of the myths surrounding her persona. In my opinion, the best biography of Eva Peron in the English language is Nicholas Fraser & Maryssa Navarro's informative and well researched book. Like Barnes book, it has been re-issued several times under several titles, the most current being ""Evita: The Real Life of Eva Peron"". JM Taylor's ""Eva Peron: The Myths of a Woman"" is also helpful and well documented and Robert Crassweller's ""Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina"" is well researched, well-written and is one of the best Peron biographies available anywhere. There is a huge difference between the woman portrayed in the books I mentioned above and the heinous character depicted here. The Eva Peron that John Barnes presents to us was an extraordinary woman but incredibly ruthless, vain and unpleasant. It's the exact same Eva Peron portrayed in the erroneous musical that bears her name. Like many other anti-Evita biographers before and after, Barnes is clearly fascinated by Eva Duarte despite the harsh character flaws he sees in her. Mary Main, Tim Rice, George Bruce, WA Harbinson, all have written scandalous and in some instances down-right malicious books about the woman and display her as an ambitious monster who squashed anyone that got in her way but for some reason, they did not hate her, at least not to the extent you'd expect. Why is that? Was it because she was a woman? Was it because she was so young and beautiful? The director of the stage play, Harold Prince stated that in his opinion Eva Peron was a ""villian"" corrupted by power but something about her drew him to her and he cited her gender as one of the reasons. Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber stated that Evita was ""extremely attractive"" and possessed qualities that were admirable despite being the most ""unsympathetic"" character he has ever written music for. For those like Prince and Webber, who consider Eva to be an amoral, murderous dictator it's hard to believe that they would feel any kind of sympathy towards her but like Barnes, they do. Eva's youth, gender, glamour and charisma have a lot to do with it but in Eva Peron's case it's something more. There is something about her that intrigues even those who despise her and that is rare. One should also keep in mind that if Evita has become ""immortal"", her detractors are as much to blame for this as her admirer's. John Barnes' book tries hard to condemn her but in the end, it loves her to pieces.""Evita First Lady: A Biography of Eva Peron"" is an entertaining read but it's too flawed, too historically inaccurate to be considered a good biography. Maryssa Navarro, Nicholas Fraser, JM Taylor, A Dujovne Ortiz, Robert Crassweller and a countless others have done better. Give their books a try before committing your time to this unless you are more interested in reading a more sensationalized and imprecise narrative of Eva Duarte de Peron's life story.",book

398,"In Detroit, partners Anna Prescott and Janet Raye Matthews run Prescott-Raye Catering that provides wholesome meals to bachelor members of the Detroit Lions football team. Among the clients is superstar receiver Gavin Mathis, who actually was the impetus for starting the program. Gavin asks Anna to help him with his teenage half-brother Kyle, whom his father just dumped on him. Neither Kyle nor Gavin knew of one another until addicted gambler George Reynolds left the kid with his older sibling. Anna agrees to help Gavin with Kyle.As Kyle adapts to being wanted by his brother and Anna and her family, Gavin and Anna, though long time friends, fall in love. However, Gavin must first deal with George, who tries to ""sell"" him Kyle before he can declare his forever love to Anna.UNFORGETTABLE is an interesting relationship drama that plays out on several levels besides the obvious romance between the lead couple. George is a poor man's version of the wastrel younger brother in the movie Parenthood. Any dealings with him are negative because he is so possessed by gambling he cannot see anyone else's needs. The Lions and their spouses and Anna's immediate family and her partner provide security and warmth that also enables the audience to see deep inside the two stars. Still, it is the nurturing Anna and the All-Pro Gavin who score the winning touchdown for contemporary romance readers.Harriet Klausner",book

What kept it going were the good actors.<br /><br />But the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like Tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. Tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. At best it is for teenagers, and I am sure many of them find the character of Johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min. The other problem I have with it is that the story fades away towards the end more and more, thou I tried to find a recovery point. Maybe it didn't recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny. Also, like in many movies, sure, good actors who can afford it don't seem to demand a better dialogue, or just turn down the script.",movie
405,"In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis did a TV Too Young To Die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in Kalifornia. I have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film.<br /><br />Kalifornia finds aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girl friend, art photographer Michelle Forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact he's got a most unusual odyssey planned, he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are flat broke.<br /><br />Fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip. It turns out Pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own, delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality.<br /><br />Kalifornia is not the type of film I usually go for, but in fact the acting ability and charisma of Brad Pitt make it work to a large degree. Pitt is the walking definition of an inbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance. But better than he is is Juliette Lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well. Watch her scene with Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialog and Forbes's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country.<br /><br />For those who like their slasher flicks, they don't come better than Kalifornia.",movie

409,"This was the fifth Desmond Cory novel I read and up to a point I was a little surprised with my findings. My early thoughts, while reading Undertow, another of the Johnny Fedora series of novels; was where is this story going? While he remained fantastically descriptive and took me in to the psyche of the `bad guys' I was sometimes finding myself thinking something was lacking as there were segments of relative inactivity, compared to some of the works I had previously read. I have since discovered that this has been a criticism of his writing style by some. It is not something I was consciously aware of when reading other Cory novels. However, the lack of action throughout is not to say the book is not worthwhile. It is still a superb read when you can accept that the action does not come thick and fast.One of the beauties of the Johnny Fedora series is that you do not need to have read any of the previous novels to fully appreciate or relate to the characters. In typical Cory style, it is very much an individual story line that sucks you in and holds you in suspense until the very end.The basic plot is for Johnny to find a double agent named Moreno who had since become somewhat of a psychopathic killer, leaving teasing signatures on his victims. The novel also features another change of scenery, this time in the 1950's in Spain. The plot takes you to the sea bed of the Gibraltar Straits where a Nazi U-Boat was sunk. A significant discovery is contained within that could forever change the balance of power across the globe. The plot also introduces a Russian spy who is also in pursuit of the U-boat, and a deadly woman whose part in events is central to the plot.In traditional Cory style, I was swept away in the latter stages as the big picture he was painting in my mind began to reveal itself, making yet another sublime thriller that was superbly written with a richness of the characters, something he never fails to achieve.Is it as good as the earlier Johnny Fedora stories? Absolutely! There are, as always, lots of twists, subtle sub plots and on reflection you gain an appreciation of why he writes in the style he does. Think of it as a slow Sunday stroll that bursts in to a short sprint as a finale as everything you have read falls in to place.As with all the Desmond Cory novels I have read so far I will certainly read this one again as I found it wonderfully entertaining all in all.",book

411,"No epidemic has equaled the devastation of the Bubonic Plague, which decimated between one-third and three-quarters of Europe's population in the Middle Ages and continued to flare up in destructive pockets for centuries after. In Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks eerily captures every aspect of life during the plague -- the gruesomely painful death, the speed with which the disease spread and the superstitions surrounding it, which rivaled the plague itself for horror.Brooks takes as her inspiration the town of Eyam, a real-life village in England's Derbyshire countryside. The skeleton of her novel comes from history, from a mysterious and unpredicted outbreak of the plague in Eyam. For reasons we will never know for sure, but which played fiercely on the writer's imagination, the people of Eyam took a vow not to run from their village in the hope of saving themselves. Instead, they stayed put and nursed each other until death did them part. It is reasonable to view this extraordinary sacrifice as a public service, as the inhabitants of Eyam thus kept the contagion within their village when they could so easily have panicked and, in fleeing the scene of death, taken the infection all over rural England.The Bubonic Plague may sound like a morbid subject. Yet the topic fascinates, in part because a study of the plague is always a study in human nature, revealing the extremes of nobility and depravity people are capable of when faced with pain and fear of the unknown. Brooks uses the story of Eyam as a backdrop for characters and stories that illustrate these extremes.Year of Wonders could not have been an easy novel to write. In the ordinary disaster narrative, suspense comes from not knowing whether the community under attack will survive its menace. But anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the Black Death knows from the beginning how Year of Wonders will end. At least two-thirds of the village will die. As a microcosm of the epidemic, Eyam's death toll will mirror the plague's overall totals.So Brooks must create suspense elsewhere, surprising us by how this character rises to the challenge with tireless dedication while that one succumbs to depression and another loses her mind. The full range of plague-related superstitions finds its way into Brooks' Eyam. Some villagers look for a witch to blame while others dabble in witchcraft, hoping to ward off their fate. One character takes to self-flagellation in the hope of placating an angry Christian God.The story is told through the eyes of Anna Frith, a young woman with two boys to raise. Frith is the widow of a miner, and she works as a servant in the homes of the village squire and rector. In most ways, she is a conventional, if unusually quick-witted, woman. She married young, her education is haphazard, and she is disinclined to question the religious beliefs that serve as the town's infrastructure. Were it not for the plague, she would no doubt have lived and died in the same 17th century English country village, without leaving a detectable trace. The extraordinary circumstances of the plague derail her from this path of least resistance and evoke a heroism in her character of which even she herself is only vaguely aware until the novel's last pages.A native of Australia and a former correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, Geraldine Brooks has previously written two critically acclaimed works of nonfiction, Foreign Correspondence and Nine Parts of Desire. With Year of Wonders, she proves equally adept at writing gripping historical fiction.",book
412,"on old ideas. Some of the material was quite novel; some of it was fairly pedestrian; other tidbits, just plain obscure. At any rate, Gladwell makes some compelling points, and the book is entertaining most of the way through. A few dull chapters can be expected when reading about what I'd loosely call social science.Gladwell's conclusions were largely left unproven, and he liberally used ""post hoc, ergo proptor hoc"" reasoning. Obviously, predecessor events do not necessarily *cause* subsequent events, but their occurrence is still of interest. Obvious or recent predecessor events are still the best place to *start looking* for answers.I was a little disappointed in the NY Crime section(s), which dealt very little with the individual psychological effects (in the minds of criminals) of a publicized 'war on crime'. At least some appreciable segment of would-be criminals are deterred from committing crimes for fear of being caught and punished. Having dealt with a few undereducated, underprivileged potential felons, I think Gladwell credits them with a bit broader perspective than they truly possess.I found the Hush-Puppies assertions and evidence to be, far-and-away, his crowning achievement in the book. This is the clearest, best understood, most uncomplicated, and most likely assertion he makes. BOILERPLATE: ""Kids who are cool buy weird shoes (and various other weird stuff). Other kids, who yearn to be cool, emulate the consumer choices of the cool kids. This is contagious, especially among kids, but among adults as well. How far and fast it spreads is a result of how cool it is, and the sheer numbers of cool kids championing the newest thing before it fizzles."" Interestingly, the same analogy can no longer be made for cigarette smoking, and Gladwell rightly takes an unpopular (though arguably correct) position on that as well.Though I find the data sparse and conclusions only partially substantiated, it's still a darn fun book. It's bound to challenge you a little, perhaps a lot. I recommend it for a medium to long flight. You can consume this book in a day or two, and there is interesting material in almost every chapter. I'm glad I read it.DISCLAIMER: You should know I research and read reviews and excerpts before deciding to invest my time and/or money in a book or product.

413,"The first book in the series was brilliant. Eragon was a charming book, dispite the three star rating I gave it. Eldest, however, deserves nothing but a one star. Even though you will find it remarkably similar to the first book, this book lacks charm.The first book was charming because of its characters. In this book, Eragon starts off as a young and innocent person. However, in this book, he undergoes training to become stronger. He comes more to terms with reality and looses his innocents. He becomes rapped up in wisdom, like Saphira, and he's not an encouraging character anymore. Older people might believe Eragon's decisions in this book are wiser, but his decisions don't relate to the choices readers would make in his place.Saphira is a much more disappointing character. She remains the same, but she is hidden in the story. It isn't clear what she is training for, but her wisdom is now taking the better half of her. Her smugness is clouded with decisions, like why should they actually rebel against Galbatorix. My favorite part of the story is the end, when Saphira is finally released and feels free from this torturous training program.The world of Alagesia has also been reduced. The world used to be big in the first book. Now, it is small and filled with unsurprising events. We literally forget 'why' we hate Galbatorix so much because his empire plays a less interesting role in the plot development. The Coming of Age theme has now gone too far. This series has now turned into war books.The book also adresses unimportant issues I managed to slave through. This book has rituals, customs, art and (worst of all) religion. Why do fantasy authors make fake religions for their stories? Eragon brutally learns these religions and almost believes them. What mind numbing garbage. Finally, the story lacks action and was boring till the end.",book

419,"If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical (or Torah) portrayal of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion people who are not even in the Bible have been ""created"" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. Jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a Shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advise. God is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that Moses had to figure things out for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />This movie is a typical Humanistic twist on Biblical things and attempts to put most of the responsibility on Moses for trying to understand what God wants and what he should do. Those who know the book of Exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie, but outright glaring changes to events. Most importantly, they will see a near total absence of God's dialog with Moses, which determines everything Moses does after the burning bush. Far from being alone as portrayed in the movie, Moses is guided by God with detailed and direct communication.<br /><br />Even Hallmark apparently can't acknowledge God's direct role, and without his spoken words to Moses many events make no sense. To compensate, Hallmark has actually changed some things. For instance, after the golden calf God plagues the people and they must look upon a symbol of a serpent to live. Hallmark creates a civil war instead and the Israelites pick sides, then slaughter each other. Moses side wins of course.<br /><br />There may be minimal value in this movie to unbelievers since it may cause them to seek answers, but believers should stay away. The twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone who doesn't know their Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.",movie

421,"It's really scary to think Aldous Huxley wrote about a fictional world in the early-1930s that was considered really far out when this book was first published, but that is quickly becoming reality everyday. He expressed surprise in a later edition of this book at how quickly that fictional world was materializing during his own lifetime. If only he stuck around a while longer (although physically impossible), he would have seen that world fully materialize even quicker than he could have ever imagined.I was really freaked out the more I got into the book. Much emphasis is placed on the ""Community, Identity, Stability"" motto (that was mentioned less than a handful of times in the book), as well as the over-dependence on drugs (soma) to make everything all right, but not enough emphasis is placed on the sexual promiscuity that permeated the fictional, futuristic London (hey, I love sex just like the next person, but not with everyone I look at!). Also, not enough attention is paid to the fact that ""feelies"" (movies where the audience gets a first-hand experience into the ""action"" experienced by the characters), along with the soma, and everything else in this future society were all designed to take peoples' minds off the fact that they were being controlled. Is that not how it is nowadays?Instead of feelies, we have Internet porn, E! (a 24 hour cable channel devoted to celebrity gossip), completely mindless, brain-numbing ""reality"" shows, the idiot box in general, and an American philosophy of having to ""keep up with the Joneses"" (as the saying goes) - choosing to live a lifetime of debt in order to have the biggest and most current of everything. It leaves little time to worry about the more important things in life such as how your government is wasting your money everyday, the incompetence of your government as a whole, how your votes really don't count (unless you vote for the candidate the machine favors), etc. Then again, anything political has always been considered ""boring"" (just like in the ""Brave New World"").This is not to say this is everyone, but I find that too many people today regard books with disdain like the people in Huxley's fictional world (especially younger people, who actually proclaim that ""reading sucks"") - using the same reasoning Mustapha Mond did as to why books are useless. And let's see a show of hands (or, in this case, posts) as to how many people would rather buy a brand new shirt or pair of pants rather than try to repair that rip or sew a button? (And I have been guilty of that in the past).The thing that shocked me the most was the popular mindset (brainwashing) in the ""Brave New World"" that being alone is equal to being a weirdo. I'm seeing more and more of that ""reasoning"" in the mass media nowadays. If someone is a ""loner,"" something is automatically ""wrong"" with them (I went through the same thing during my school days in the 80s and 90s). If someone's shy they're ""stuck up,"" being aloof is always cause for alarm, and don't even think about wearing a trench coat!In the ""Brave New World,"" being together with people all the time takes your mind off of all potential problems. Any problems that do come up are to be avoided with a healthy dose of soma and, better yet, with a soma vacation. And, in the end, only certain people can perform certain tasks in life.I liked the way Huxley didn't tie things up in the end. It's a shame the ""Savage"" was continually tortured by the hip and happening populace of London up until the very end. The Savage could be anyone who doesn't subscribe to the popular mindset, someone who dares goes against the grain and doesn't back down.It can't be stressed enough that Huxley was a prophet. ""Brave New World,"" whether people like this or not, *is* the America of 2007. We have the power to reverse that trend, but people (except a few) just don't seem to want to.Along with George Orwell's ""1984"" and Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" this is an excellent trilogy of a blissfully ignorant future that is fast becoming reality. - Donna Di Giacomo",book
422,"A wonderful, free flowing, often lyrical film that whisks you along, ever smiling, even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way. One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well. This is possibly Depardieu's best performance, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age. Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play. Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant/romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect.",movie

I am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. The acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either. In no other movie that I've seen so far has Poirot been portrayed so brilliantly!

All of the Lifetime tropes are there- a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married), and a police department that patronizingly dismisses her complaints, forcing her to Stand Up For Herself. Especially jaw-dropping is the scene where the heroine, after enduring a break-in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, decides to relieve the stress by going shopping! Having seen first hand the harassment of a co-worker by some creep she met at church, I know stalking is not a joke, but it certainly is in this movie.",movie

431,"I started reading Ulysses with the help of the annotations, but soon left those behind. The horror stories that I had heard of the difficulty of the book were unfounded, and I enjoyed every moment of the text. Having read the Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I was used to Joyce's style, or so I thought. But in Ulysses I discovered that stream of consciousness could be taken to a new and deeper level. Joyce did not mean for us to grasp every allusion, therefore annotations are not really necessary. By reading Ulysses, I also managed to gain a new insight into the Odyssey, and found new undertones withing Homer's work. People had told me that at the age of 16 and 17 it would be impossible to read Ulysses. I disagree. Length does not make a book more difficult to read -- Walden Pond is, at times, harder to understand than Ulysses. When I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptiness, for I had been living in the mind of Leopold Bloom. It was as if part of me had been taken away. In the future, I will definitely reread Ulysses, and I recommend it to anyone who loves literature. It is a masterpiece.",book

After this marriage, everything was tragic.Deaths and fights were constantly a problem in the two houses. So Romeo and Juliet would leave Verona to stop the quarrels, but this plan failed when Lord Capulet told Juliet to marry Paris.Friar Laurence would make a new plan, to skip this ceremony. Juliet would pretend to be dead and afterwards, when wake up, leave Verona with her love.This plan also failed because Romeo didn't get to know about this and killed himself when he saw Juliet lying on her grave.

For example: will they make it to the airport in time? Things look dim as we go to a commercial¬Öand the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane! Well, I guess they're gonna make it after all¬Öbut then again, they had to because they're good guys.<br /><br />The acting wasn't any too impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid as Tornado Tommy) , the effects were kinda lame, the bad guys got it, and the good guys came through.

Not only did they wrap things up happily as quickly as a soap opera given 24 hours notice of a cancellation, but they glorified the hacker as well-intentioned.

439,"MEN OF HONOR features Cuba Gooding Jr., in what is probably his best performance to date. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of towering courage and heroism. He's a poor dirt farmer from the South, who wants to become a Navy diver- but has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist redneck that nonetheless grows to respect Brashear. The film is about how Brashear has to concur the nearly insurmountable odds, not once but twice. The performances are what make this film special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in movie history, gives a towering performance- his best dramatic work in years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as DeNiro's much younger wife. The film lays on the patriotism a little too strong (though no where near the level it was in THE PATRIOT), and a few of the characters are just one dimensionally bad (Hal Holbrook's Mr. Pappy is just so evil), but the film is a rarity among films today.

Arabic pita bread should be mostly soft not overcooked, and should be 6 to 8 inches around, as this is traditionally used as a utensil in the middle east.

After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume the normally credible Lion's Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework.<br /><br />But then that's the point, isn't it. Boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are ""announced"" or in ""pre-production"".<br /><br />These aren't movies to be directed, but investment portfolios. Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame, the more money he and his investors can gain. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway? The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark, like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy film-making.<br /><br />And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of the man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.<br /><br />For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 As an aside, just don't ask me how he's getting his cast-lists together.

I just turned nine and I have read this book three times. It is so wonderful, I know I'll read it at least three times more and then read it to my children one day. There is a lot to think about too. Without giving too much away, there is a good character who doesn't try to tell the people who arrest him that he didn't do the crime because he feels so guilty for harm that has come to others because he trusted the wrong person. There is also an especially good teacher who has to give up teaching because he seriously endangered his students even though he could easily have avoided it.My family and I are reading aloud A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens and comparing what it is like for the ex-prisoners in the two books to come back to life, at least partly.

From the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting, how long its been since they got some, when their next sexual liaison will be, and with whom it should be with. On top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes.

This film was released in 1982 (not 1987 as the IMDb database indicates) and then current ""high tech"" was an amber screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy drives. Maybe the PC was the real star of the movie... at least it was interesting.<br /><br />We got this on DVD for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at WalMart. As the other reviewer notes, we paid too much!",movie

I bought this book for $1 in a Japanese bookshop, just by curiosity, and I read it carefully.I must admit there are smart and simple ideas. The pictures are beautiful and it is well explained.I, of course, don't have such big houses as she has, but her ideas are useful even for small spaces. Nevertheless, she doesn't look more sympathetic to me now, because we don't really connect with her through her books, probably most of the ideas are found by a staff of very qualified people working for her, but it still remains interesting, neat, nice, smart, useful, elegant, convenient.I will keep this book for sure.

459,"Aquitaine is a small beautiful French restaurant in the South End. A couple of my girlfriends and I visited during Boston Restaurant Week, so our three-course meal was only $33 dollars. It felt like we were in Sex And The City. The music and the atmosphere were both modern & chic. I ordered the duck confit ravioli as an appetizer, the coq au vine rouge, without pancetta or bacon, as an entree, and the raspberry cheesecake for dessert. A lip-smacking experience to say the least. This heavenly meal was lovingly prepared. The succulent chicken retained a lot of its flavor and tenderness. Everything was unbelievably delicious! Our hostess and waitress were both incredibly friendly! It's worth the experience!",restaurant
460,"Expecting to see another Nunsploitation movie with a mean Mother Superior abusing and torturing her charges, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I had anticipated.<br /><br />It actually has a feminist storyline, though I don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set. It certainly wasn't practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society. Throughout the story, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it, albeit with disastrous results.<br /><br />The pre-credit sequence has Flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. She sees an injured ""evil"" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to assist him. Before she can, her hate-filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face (great family dynamics, huh?). After this, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. Though scenes do involve violence, rape and nuns, I would consider this more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /><br />Indeed, many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there, but the acting, camera-work, storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level. Most ""nun"" films I've seen usually have the basic premise of: A good girl somehow winds up in a convent, where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell.<br /><br />Flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-spirited (but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me, but it's a lot easier for guys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as their liberators (of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim invader, that impales dear Sister Agatha. <br /><br />It is Agatha's death that sends Flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time. I don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the conclusion. This is a great film, so don't be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epic. Plus, how on Earth could a movie featuring Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I am not familiar with Mar√≠a Casares' other works, but Sister Agatha is a hell of a character.<br /><br />I have read many great reviews of the Synapse (US) release, but I love my German X-Rated Kult DVD copy. It isn't anamorphic/16:9, but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than Synapse's release.<br /><br />And there are also many great, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many from Sister Agatha)<br /><br />""Why is God male? The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit¬Ö They're all male!"" -Flavia<br /><br />""These men are afraid- look at them, Sister- Afraid their power will be taken away from them!"" -Sr. Agatha (regarding Christians fleeing after the Muslims arrive)<br /><br />""Woman, where are you going? The Moslems can do nothing to you that the Christians haven't done! Ha Ha Ha!"" -Sr. Agatha (to a group of fleeing Christian women)<br /><br />""Lord bless these Moslems- For putting fear into these pompous Christians."" -Flavia<br /><br />""Does it take the mere sight of a Moslem to make you $h!t your underclothing?"" -Sr. Agatha<br /><br />Closing message: ""Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a runaway nun. The idea for the film came from events which occurred during the Musalman invasions of Italy culminating in what even today is remembered as THE MARTYRDOM OF THE 800 AT OTRANTO""",movie

The film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience.. it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail, just like the heist itself. It portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. It's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft. It shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. Now all things considered put on top of that a daring 28 minute sequence with not a word spoken and set in gorgeous Paris with truly great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and that last scene ...when you look up and see those trees... wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques... it is a master piece in my view and I'm glad to have seen it.",movie

He has also written mysteries under his own name with both sporting and golf backgrounds. However it is primarily the books that take place earlier in history that I am interested in.

Their leading apprentice is abducted and there is even an attempt on their patrons life.

I chose a used copy with yellowed pages but in great shape, and am halfway through a period of delightful rediscovery. Probably the most interesting part of the entire book was found on the last couple of pages offering additional science-fiction stories for sale at the 1961 price of $.60!

It's too bad because I really got hooked into the beginning. Then, like the opening soundtrack, it went from great and intriguing to basically nowhere.<br /><br />It's fun enough with plenty of curiosities and interesting characters acted well. I'm sure that will be enough for many people. The problem is it all feels contrived and empty which, ironically, is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self realization.

488,"They say that crab fishing is the most dangerous job on earth and that is probably true. On the other hand one would think that being a professional genealogist would be one of the safest jobs on earth. After all, what could happen to a genealogist? Maybe a paper cut or two and a pair of really strained eyes but real danger would seem to be out of the question. But apparently there are pitfalls that can put the poor genealogist in harms way. Say for example you are doing a family tree for a lady in Birmingham Alabama who is seeking membership in the United Daughters of the Confederacy and you find that she is descended from General Sherman of all people. Did she jump or was she pushed? That is the question that my favorite pair of Southern sisters must answer when a genealogist cousin of Mary Alice's new son-in-law does a swan dive from a tenth floor window of the courthouse. The police call it a suicide but Mouse doesn't think so.Mary Alice (Sister) and Patricia Anne (Mouse) are a pair of sisters who are about as different as different can be and they keep getting sucked into deadly mysteries. There always seems to be a former student of retired teacher Patricia Anne involved in these mysteries and this book makes no exception. Both Mouse's husband Fred and Sister think that Patricia Anne must have taught everybody in Birmingham because no matter where they go a former student shows up. This time the former student shows up later than usual however and the sisters are not drawn into the mystery by the involvement of Mouse's former pupil, as has been the case before. This time the two have just had lunch with the victim before she takes her leap and their curiosity is naturally peaked. Especially when a stripper finds the naked body of the victim's ex-husband with an extra eye socket in his head.As with most mysteries of this type the plot is not overly deep and it takes several detours along the way. The hilarious interaction between the sisters however more than makes up for the wandering plot and the dialogue between the characters is about the most well written and imaginative I have ever come across. Before you have read much at all you will feel like you have known these two Southern ladies all of your life and you will love them like the bickering aunts that you may or may not have had. When one of them gets herself into an extremely dangerous situation near the end of the book your adrenaline will start to pump as you wonder if the other sister will in Mighty Mouse fashion arrive just in time to save the day. This story has a little suspense, a little sibling conflict and two hundred and fifty pound Mary Alice in a hot tub with her ninety-year-old boyfriend. What more could anybody wish for in a nice cozy mystery?",book
489,"It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us inside the trials and tribulations of a group of top American scientists handed a lofty task during the Second World War: beat everyone else to the atomic bomb. Sequestered in a heavily-guarded New Mexico compound, the brainiacs slowly turn the idea from ambitious concept into immense reality.<br /><br />FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those films that requires your close attention. It's a real thinking person's movie, not only from the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon, but also the moral implications of contributing to killing on a massive scale. Characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime duty as Americans. The film is never preachy about, however, leaving us free to marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil these men face. The performances deserve special mention as well. Paul Newman delivers one of his great, understated performances as the Pattonesque general in charge of delivering the ultimate big stick for the Allied Forces.<br /><br />Where FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY loses much of its traction is in the unnecessary romantic component. Dwight Schultz as the leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. Director Roland Joffe apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story, but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction. Besides, it's the interaction among the scientists and their military hierarchy that give us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men.<br /><br />Still, it's difficult not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It's a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face put on one of the most intriguing stories in human history.",movie

Soon enough John is hooked onto it, but something supernatural doesn't like him interfering with the dead, as now other then contacting his wife, the white noise is foretelling events before they happen.<br /><br />Since this DVD has been sitting on my shelf for a while now, I thought I better get around to watching it since it wasn't my copy. But then again I don't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back, as they haven't question me about it. Oh well. So I decided to give it a play, as I was in an undemanding mood. After hearing and reading all the bad press on it, I wasn't expecting anything remotely good, but I was kept entertained for 90 minutes. Well, more so the 60 minutes, as the last half-an-hour was pretty much a blur of confusion. The film is nowhere as good as it could have been, but the time breezed by quick enough even though it's a rather tepid supernatural thriller. I thought it wasn't all a waste. The first hour I found some effective sequences rather interesting and there's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you, but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film. That's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn't fit in with the context. It becomes rather hectic, loud and very muddled with its MTV style editing and kinetic camera-work that gets to close into the action. I couldn't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax. The whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey. It's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big, but hits rock bottom. I thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera-work. Other then the distinctively stark lighting, the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy. All of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware, which makes it come across as very sterile and empty.<br /><br />You can easily see that the film's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story. There's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material. After a while, it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood-curdling stuff from beyond the grave. It just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy TV screen after while. The E.V.P machine was the star on the show. Well, it did have more impact than the limp performances. Michael Keaton is more than capable actor, but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed John Rivers. He really deserves much better, though. Everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable. Not because of the performances, but of the lack of depth in their characters. This clunker wasn't bad to begin with, but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically.<br /><br />I wouldn't care to see it again and I wouldn't recommend to anyone, unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of Hollywood produced horror/thrillers. It's just a damn shame that this over-produced flick couldn't put it together successfully, as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand.

495,"Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. ""Rosenstrasse,"" which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by, of all peoples, generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street.<br /><br />Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II.<br /><br />The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance, Ruth not only ""sits shivah"" (the Jews' week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. Her American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting, handsome Luis. Stay tuned.<br /><br />A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families, in whole but usually in part, escaped the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed.<br /><br />So Hannah, having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life, traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Were she not, this would have been a very short film. But Ruth, pretending to be a historian, locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow. As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story, the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital.<br /><br />The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use ""Israel"" as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add ""Sarah"" to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false ""Israel"" included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation).<br /><br />While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those married to ""Aryans"" were exempted. For a time. Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity.<br /><br />The young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up, some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them (""Jew-loving whore"" being one appellation). As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember, Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde. <br /><br />Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men, and a handful of women, are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story).<br /><br />Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly, one gathers, begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued, the child whose mother was murdered.<br /><br />The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943, a set, and the street today in a bustling, rebuilt, unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well.<br /><br />The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times's critic appears not to know that).<br /><br />Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper, to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim ""copy and paste"" school of Teutonic nastiness. But that's understandable.<br /><br />The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. THAT'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on.<br /><br />The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was ""a ray of light"" in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So ""a ray of light"" it was and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists. And always will.<br /><br />9/10",movie

It was an excellent version and very much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was horrified. William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is story about love and passion, but I couldn't see it in this version. No, back to the BBC-version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.",movie

499,"For a country that has produced some of the world's finest dramatists and has such a rich musical heritage it has always been a source of bewilderment to me why so much of Ireland's home-grown cinema has been so appalling. Perhaps because, by its very nature, those talented in the field of Irish cinema have been quick to abandon their native shore for careers in Britain or America, (Colin Farrell is a recent case in point), and that the really successful Irish directors that have continued to work in Ireland and with Irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market. I am thinking particularly of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan who alternate between films with an Irish setting and projects filmed abroad.<br /><br />""Middletown"", however, is very much an Irish film even if two of its principal actors are English. It's certainly well-made of its kind and might have bucked the trend that Irish films aren't really very good; (Paddy Breathnach's ""I Went Down"", written by the brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is a crucial exception). Unfortunately this tale of fundamentalism set in a fictitious Irish town, presumably in the North of Ireland judging by the accents, (Mid-Ulster Bible-Belt, if you ask me), and presumably in the recent past, (the fifties? the sixties?), is so over-the-top that it really is quite ridiculous.<br /><br />Nothing in the film rings true and you can't help feeling it's writer, Daragh Carville, has been strongly influenced by Flannery O'Connor and that the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set in the American bible-belt and not in Ireland where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist was never quite as loony as this. It's all meant be to be grim in a grand guignol kind of way and it certainly is, though I was more prone to giggles than frisson's at the right Reverand Matthew Macfayden's antics. He has the Ulster accent off pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as Mays' wife but the script is so appallingly derivative that good acting can do nothing to save the film. So rather than a step up the ladder for Irish cinema ""Middletown"" is, I'm afraid, just another nail in its coffin.",movie

501,"This book is a classic and introduces so many themes that are prevalent in literature today but I find myself disliking the novel itself. Bronte tells the story of a man who is renting a room and learns the story of the man who owns the house and the neighboring property, Mr. Heathcliff. This may be the only novel that I've ever read in which every single main character is utterly unlikable: from Heathcliff who is cruel and sadistic to everyone except Catherine, who is shallow to her husband Edgar, who is proud and weak, to his sister Isabella, who is naive and immature, to Hindley, who is nothing more than a vengeful little boy who grows into a vengeful man. His son, Hareton is tolerable though he is depicted as stupid. Then we come to Cathy who is a spoiled little brat. Even the man original narrator, Lockwood, comes across as pretentious. The only redeeming character in my eyes was Nelly, who is flawed but loving. That being said, the novel is so well written and presents it's characters in such a light that you feel like you know them. The prevailing message seems to be that no matter how fall someone has fallen, they can redeem themselves with love. Not sure that I believe this but I can't deny that Bronte work prevails as a masterpiece of literature.",book

503,"I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We were learning about space. All little kids want to go to space, right?

I thought it was some news program or something. I guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'War of the Worlds.' So, recently, I get this movie again to watch, realizing my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, did you ever notice that? I don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow.<br /><br />The best part is when Andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank, and begins to float backwards as the security doors close.

505,"In 1876 Mark Twain proposed to William Dean Howells, the editor of the Atlantic Monthly, that a number of authors including Twain himself each write a story--""'blindfolded' as to what the others had written""--based on the same skeleton plot, which Twain would devise. In the end the idea came to nothing, or almost nothing, because Howells never managed to interest other authors in taking on the task. But Twain did write his own contribution to the project. His A Murder, A Mystery, and a Marriage is a curious story about a greedy farmer's attempts to line his pockets by marrying his daughter off to a wealthy suitor. The farmer's plot is complicated, however, by his estranged brother's will and by the appearance in town, under unusual circumstances, of a multilingual stranger. The mystery--there is, after all, a murder in the tale--is laid to rest in Twain's final chapter with the unlikely introduction of Jules Verne into the story. Twain never published his novella, and part of the manuscript was lost for more than a hundred years. It appeared in print for the first time in 2001.The Norton paperback of A Murder, A Mystery, and a Marriage includes four facsimile pages of Twain's manuscript and is beautifully illustrated with watercolors by Peter de S?ve. In a brief foreword and a nearly forty-page afterword Roy Blount Jr. discusses the history of the manuscript and places the story in the larger context of Twain's more familiar work and the politics of the day. It is not the most interesting of essays, but Twain fans who are sufficiently familiar with his oeuvre and with mid-nineteenth-century politics may appreciate it.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)",book
506,"Is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television (or the media in general) as the 1960s? No. And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time? Not really. But if we must have one, does it have to be as shallow as ""The '60s""? <br /><br />I like to think that co-writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted, especially given Couturie's involvement in the superb HBO movie ""Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam"" which utilized little original music and no original footage, letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves. This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production, but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time; like so many of its ilk, it's seen from the point of view of one family. But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s (it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont), making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade.<br /><br />The makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character, with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children's father is especially clich√©d - and then when they're back on BLAMMO! it's something else. Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly. In fairness, Jerry O'Connell, Jordana Brewster, Jeremy Sisto, Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try, but they're wasted (especially the latter two); it's undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton, and Rosanna Arquette (in an uncredited cameo in part 2) is always welcome.<br /><br />What isn't welcome is how ""The '60s"" drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect (and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles, no Rolling Stones... then again, there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album, right?). Capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending, ""American Dreams"" and ""The Wonder Years"" did it all much, much better. Nothing to see here you can't see elsewhere, people... except for Julia Stiles doing the twist, that is.",movie

508,"As noted in other reviews, the cover is misleading in suggesting this is written by the Dalai Lama. The book is written by the rather average writer and psychiatrist Howard Cutler who lists his name as second author although he is really the sole author. Cutler uses quotations from some interviews he had with the Dalai Lama to justify the deceptive authorship credit. The quotations are very thinly spread through the book and you will find nothing new here. I presume this is legal, but I felt cheated and really struggled to extend loving compassion to Cutler and the publishers of this book. Read some of the texts really written by the Dalai Lama or the excellent and beautifully written book ""Happiness"" by Matthieu Ricard instead.",book
509,"Thornton Wilder is hands-down my favorite author, but all the same I was a bit nervous in picking up these two earlier novels as they both are dwarfed by his later material. Luckily, my apprehension was uncalled for. Although these two novels aren't vintage Wilder, they still stand a full head above most of the literature at the time.The Cabala is Wilder's first novel and has something of a slow start. The novel is about a young American student spending a year in Rome, only to get involved with and witness the dissolution of the Cabala - an informal group of outdated societal elites. Of course, Wilder has always proved himself to be an excellent writer in form and that's enough to keep the reader going along, as long the reader does not mind a little academia thrown into the mix. About a quarter of the way through, though, the novel's plot has picked up enough pace to keep the reader interested on its own merits. The end of the novel, though, is worth the read on its own. Wilder has such a way to bring things to a beautiful and touching conclusion, and this what we get with The Cabala, and this is where we glimpse what Wilder's writing will look like when it fully matures. It's a very powerful ending.The Woman of Andros was written after Wilder had already become an established name in the American literary scene, and is all but forgotten now. This is really a shame. It introduces Chrysis, a courtesan, who lives on the Greek island of Andros before the birth of Christ. Although she attracts and often interacts with the prominent young men of the island, she also collects around her the outcasts of society and cares for them (including her younger sister who becomes involved with one of the young men). Now although this all sounds like it could make for a wonderfully complex plot, the plot is secondary for this short novel. Much like The Bridge of San Luis Rey, The Woman of Andros is more driven by its philosophical undertones than the actual plot. If the reader wants a more plot-driven book, he should look elsewhere. And although books like this often become bogged down in their own ideals and become top-heavy, the brevity of the novel keeps everything in check and allows this novel to actually be one of the more rewarding reading experiences that can be had from a Wilder novel (which is saying a lot).",book

512,"First To Die 2003<br /><br />I'll admit my mistake first: I didn't realize this was a made for TV movie. I was ""thrown off"" by the ""R"" certification. The plot is strong, but the movie is about 40 minutes too long. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The down side of the movie is that it definitely falls into the ""chick flick"" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should call for an ""R"" rating. There is no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes. Actually, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa, and Glynis Davies were all guests on the SG-1 series, but this movie did nothing to advance their careers since they were all used as low level supporting actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as he usually is and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher who I came to respect as an actor during the Millennium series, was given nothing challenging to show her range of abilities. The greatest disappointment with regard to the cast was Tracy Pollan. Aside from being a below average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself muting the TV during her dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Lifetime TV type of programs. I would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however. Considering I found nothing that would cause censorship, this is a movie that is worthy for only watching on TV, since nothing will be cut out. As a TV movie I would rate this as a 5 out 10. As a feature film with an ""R"" certification and such as strong cast, I rate it as a 2 out of ten.",movie

I loved the quote at the end, about imagined Maginaw (did I spell that right?) lines, enemies we imagine, fights that are all in our heads. Wow, high school and even college age is full of these complex relationships. Not like now (haha)...What I got re-reading this last year was the richness and intricacies of our relationships with key people in our lives. I thought that the question was not did he/didn't he, clearly he did, but are all of these confusing relationships with others so entirely meshed with our own view and relationship with ourselves? I thought the relationship between the boys was as complex, rich, multifaceted, and many-at-once as you could hope for.I have also noted that at times of political unrest, authors turn to the setting of boarding school as a microcosm of innocence and fraternaty; I can't remember it now, but there was a similarly set book on the best seller list late last year, and many others. I had missed, on first reading, the import of the war as backdrop in A Separate Peace, with war the mover of lives and the ender of innocence. As a separte theme, an interesting one. Care to plot novels set at boarding school against periods of unrest?

My favorite was the shot of the P-40 crashing into the row of parked P-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it just gets worse from there.<br /><br />There's two black guys and two white guys as American POWs, as well as some Filipinos POWs and Japanese guards. The ranking POW of the Americans is a white naval Lieutenant, which is of course an O-3 in the navy. At any rate, he's in need of a haircut, badly, distractingly badly. Hockey hair does not belong in a WWII movie. Oh, and he's a racist. He doesn't want to share quarters with the 'negros'. Of course in real life, he wouldn't want to share quarters with the white enlisted guy either. I think the Geneva Convention has a clause about officers quarters and enlisted but that wasn't the point here. Oh well, I think plot is secondary to other issues in this flick. He gets put in his place and pretty much spends the rest of the movie as a look out and running the air pump for the divers.<br /><br />But once you get going, it's not a bad story line. The japs want the divers to raise the silver thrown out by the Americans before Corrigador fell. The Filipino resistance wants them to take their time. And the POWs do their best to help. A potentially good story and not that badly done I guess. A bit unbelievable when the POWs use camp made re-breathers to swim between the POW camp and the Filipino village, every night. Maybe I'm not that picky when I know going in that this is not a blockbuster film. I guess that's why it comes on a 20-pack DVD war movie collection for five bucks.<br /><br />The 70s music did not belong in this movie or any WWII movie. It's quite distracting to say the least.

By the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was. Don't be like them, just pass this by. I'm sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie.",movie
530,"I discovered this book first as an age-browned paperback with disintegrated binding on my dad's bookshelf many decades ago. He had a fondness for books by people with original minds and this book he once cited as an example. I had to agree after I read it. I've owned several hardback copies since. I used to give them to friends but as they've disappeared from second hand stores I'm determined to keep my latest. If you find one my advice is to buy it without hesitation.You'll not likely find a more entertaining books of historical essays in modern print. Bolitho/Ryall's curiously baroque prose style is as original as his contagious irreverence for and astonishment at the lives of his subjects. They aren't all as riveting his chapter on Charles XII of Sweden, but those that shine are virtually incandescent. For my money, the chapter on Mahomet (aka Mohammed) is worth the price by itself. In all the years since--even in this age of Jihad--I have yet to find an account of the founding of Islam so brief and incisive in describing its prophet. That it is also howlingly funny ought to be irrelevant, but I suppose that's because we've been inured to the idea that serious scholarship should be comprehensive, conventional and alas, boring.",book
531,"The story in this movie is fairly implausible B grade stuff, but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead, and in 1940, that meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner Stephen Danel, who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine. Upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danel.<br /><br />Only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves; Danel's wife, and monkeys. Monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get.<br /><br />Lorre is perfect in his role here, and creeps up the screen in industrial-strength fashion. Although the script is not Casablanca caliber, the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very watchable story, but I'm not sure what niche this movie filled. Too long for a short subject, and too short for a feature length film, I'm not sure how this was marketed to theaters.<br /><br />I just caught this for the first time on a late night/early morning TCM showing. Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it.",movie

535,"Uta Hagen's ""Respect for Acting"" is the standard textbook in many college theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the Presentational approach, and the Representational approach. In the Presentational approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. In the Representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound.<br /><br />The Representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made. British theater has a long history of this style of acting, and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the Representational school.<br /><br />Time has not been kind to this school of acting, or to this movie. Nearly every working actor today uses a Presentational approach. To the modern eye, Olivier's highly enunciated, stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stilted. Instead of creating an internally conflicted Hamlet, Olivier made a declaiming, self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger London theaters, but is far too starchy to carry off a modern Hamlet.<br /><br />And so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. Olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally funny: ""In-stead, you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it... Smooth-ness!"" Instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost (as any proper actor could), bright fill lights in Olivier's pupils give us that impression.<br /><br />Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet, putting in a good essay at the Queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). The other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done, given Olivier's tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! <br /><br />Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable, flawed Hamlet, and instead elected to portray a sort of Elizabethan bullhorn. Final analysis: ""I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.""",movie

The food is overwhelmingly bland and lacks any type of flavor. The way they word the menu you think you have ordered the best of the best. And that the food if going to be amazing but it's not. The drinks are also on Oskar amazing sounding but when you get them they are disgusting, strong yes but not good at all.

I could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead-end home town in Tennessee to Florida, with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten-up car.<br /><br />The heroine, Ruby, makes some false starts, but learns from them. I found myself wondering why, why didn't she lean a bit more on Mike's shoulder, but...she has her reasons, as it turns out.<br /><br />Just a fine film.

I also found the inclusion of hand written descriptions quite helpful and gives this book a mixed media-like look. When you factor in the huge changes that this region is undergoing and the fact that I suspect that much of what is pictured in this book is either gone or horribly transformed (the Lux Parfumerie series is a good example of this transformation for the worse in my humble opinion), then this book's content becomes downright invaluable.",book
539,"Grabbed my attention on Netflix Instant Play because it was only an hour and a half long (it's nearing 4 am here), and because it's Norwegian, which I wanted to follow up with Dead Snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now. A droll and deliciously wry romp, this movie features a man, Andreas, who gets shipped out to some Purgatory of a Brave New World city, where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste, nothing smells, and even sex loses its appeal. Driven to the edge by his lack of common senses, he feels nearly ready to kill himself.<br /><br />After an hilarious botched attempt at latter, Andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates. The two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side, tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see. But of course, in fantasy allegory land, desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end Andreas' attempt at freedom and sensuality.<br /><br />Jens Lien and crew create a simple, straight-forward movement to the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging. The similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth enumerating, but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones. I like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than The Passion of the Christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray-toned mise-en-scene. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings, which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about, everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB",movie

544,"This book gave me the heebie geebies the entire time I was reading it.My issues with this book:I am pretty skeptical of the claims of the author. While I do not doubt the psychological effect of having a good attitude and speaking what we want and not dwelling on what we do not have, I am continually battling the spiritual claims of this book with questions as I read it. Questions like: what about God's sovereignty and the will of God? What about God's omnipotence and power over everything regardless of what we do? Capps does not seem to truly go to the Word, only what the Word can do for us.I believe we should say personal affirmations (for lack of a better term) for the profound psychological effects of a positive attitude. However, in this book, Capps supports each claim and each point with scripture that seems to me to be taken entirely out of context. My first thoughts were that he was pulling scripture out to support each paragraph he wrote.Had I sufficient proof that Capps was an educated scholar of the Old and New Testaments and knew Greek and Hebrew and had gone back to the original text, I would be less wary than I am. In the first chapter the hackles stood up on the back of my neck. I continually prayed for wisdom as I read this. None-the-less, my feelings of skepticism did not diminish.I went to a Bible College where we were taught foundational principles of the importance of the original contexts and study. Some friends who liked this book and promoted it to me put an awful lot of importance upon the works of the Holy Spirit, and not as much focus on Jesus' life and the power of God. No balance.The good thing I did take away from this book was the importance of thinking and speaking positively - which you can get that same message in many different books without the push towards an attitude of controlling God.",book
545,"A linear travel within a non-linear structure. It's a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows in this come-and-go between present, future and past. However, the movie's linearity can't be avoided: it's the very work of the projector, the unfolding of the narrative.<br /><br />What we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. The world of this Terry Gilliam film is a world with little space for free-will.<br /><br />Right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic's prophecy, according to which a plague would rule the Earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus.<br /><br />Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: return to the mid 90's to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus. There's no way to change the past: all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present (that, for us viewers, is the future) find the cure. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but make the present better.<br /><br />In his ""returns"" in time, Cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present.<br /><br />The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect ""volunteers"" (this word is incisively ironic) to embark on the journeys to the past.<br /><br />The scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel, and Cole ends up on wrong dates - this will, later in the plot, work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe).<br /><br />We can see, through the evolution of the story, that linearity and non-linearity interlace in a circular temporality.<br /><br />There is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climactic - appears. It modifies itself, according to the evocation of Cole's memories, that come up in his dreams.<br /><br />In an airport, a man is shot dead while running, armed, toward someone else. A blonde woman runs after the murdered one.<br /><br />This is the scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents), the present (the time of the narrative) and the future (adult Cole) Throughout the narrative, Cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist, doctor Peters (Morse), that is the responsible for the dissemination of the disease.<br /><br />What was can't be changed. And, in Cole's case, what was is what will be. Eternally.<br /><br />A film not quite well understood for many. To me, nothing less than a masterpiece.<br /><br />Other good movies with similar theme: The Back to the future trilogy (that has another angle regarding the ""mad scientist"" character, and although it shares the atmosphere of decay - particularly in the second film -, it is way more optimistic than Gilliam's work, that is an odd Hollywood picture).<br /><br />In another register, there is ""Wild strawberries"", one of Bergman's masterpieces, that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscences.<br /><br />I've never watched ""La Jet√©e"", but only because I can't find it.",movie

548,"""Black Vengeance"" is an alternate title for ""Ying hung ho hon"" AKA ""Tragic Hero"" (1987). I have just seen this on VHS, together with the first part of the story, ""Gong woo ching"" (""Rich and Famous""), also 1987. (The poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-DVD set of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth movie is called ""The Black Six""). Strangely, while the characters retain their original names in ""Rich and Famous"", in ""Black Vengeance"" Chow Yun-Fat's character is named Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry, and Andy Lau is called Johnny. Also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films. Perhaps that was the year they were American-dubbed. According to the release dates given on IMDb ""Tragic Hero"" was released before ""Rich and Famous"". Was there any reason for releasing the sequel first? Despite some users' comments, I enjoyed these films, although they aren't among CYF's best such as ""The Killer"" and ""Hard-Boiled"" which are truly astonishing. However,if one day I come across a 2-DVD set of ""Rich and Famous"" and ""Tragic Hero"" I won't hesitate to buy it. Hopefully, these comments about ""Black Vengeance"" clear up, which was also for me, a mystery as to where it belonged in Chow Yun-Fat's filmography.",movie

The author seems to have had access only to a kooky local psychologist and to Rader's pastor, so don't look for detail about the police or their investigation. The emphasis on the minister is so extensive that the story almost becomes his - a struggle by the educated, liberal Christian to comprehend evil.There's some sensitive writing on this topic, and about the time and place that produced Dennis Rader, but I doubt many true crime readers will find this satisfying.

557,"As an American fan of The League of Gentlemen I had to wait months to finally see this film when it came out on DVD, but it was well worth the (excruciating) wait. ""Apocalypse"" is fantastic- funny, freaky, clever as hell, full of in-jokes and cryptic references to the television series; basically everything you'd expect from the Gentlemen.<br /><br />The plot has already been discussed in other reviews, so I won't bother re-capping it, although I will say when I first read it I was a bit hesitant. Obviously this device- fictional characters entering the real world to confront their makers- has been used before, notably in Wes Craven's underrated ""New Nightmare"" and Stephen King's ""Dark Tower"" books (where King himself was a character). The Gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall, though, and even add a new element: a second fictional world (""them days""). Soon all three realities have weaved together, and the result is exhilarating: Geoff Tipps being knighted in the middle ages (and trying to court Queen Victoria Wood); the real League of Gentlemen in Royston Vasey, being confronted by characters like Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner summoning an homunculus outside of Bernice's church. I've heard that some people disliked the ""King's Evil"" sub-plot, but I found it hilarious, especially Reece's character (who seemed to be channeling Judith the ""Witch"" from series three).<br /><br />Speaking of the characters, I was relieved to find that, although Hilary Briss, Geoff, and Herr Lipp were planted firmly in at the film's core, other, more familiar characters were given their due. Bernice's confessional in the beginning was hilarious, hearkening back to the quicker, more sketch-oriented feel of the first series. Pauline and Mickey have cameos (no Ross though- strange), although I would've loved to've seen more of Ms. Campbell-Jones. Papa Lazarou is accounted for, as are Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, giving their meager screen time an almost magical feel (and just what the HELL did Papa hack up, like an obscene hairball? According to the DVD commentary, a ""wad of greasy pubic hair"").<br /><br />The film looks incredible, but then, what's new? The music, as always, is breathtaking. I was thrilled to hear Joby Talbot's new interpretations of the theme music, and his slight re-working of the majestic, lovely piece that closes out both ""Apocalypse"" and the last episode of series three.<br /><br />I have some minor complaints- it would have been nice to see more of the old, familiar Royston Vasey, and I felt the stop-motion creatures (beautiful, by the way) were a bit underused. Both of these issues, however, can be justified by the film's budget, so they're understandable. Still, as much as I loved Bernice's new church, it would have been cool to see the final battle in the high street (the Gentlemen's original vision, according to the commentary).<br /><br />Overall, ""Apocalypse"" is astounding, especially if you're a fan of the series. I can't recommend it highly enough. 10/10.",movie
558,"Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve, (don't ask how) I may have been young, but I wasn't stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performances at a school play, And I've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.<br /><br />The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.<br /><br />I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.<br /><br />The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year.

562,"The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them. However, once the action switched to the home of Ingrid's fianc√©, it all completely fell apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film. The fianc√©'s boorish son and the military attach√©'s vying for the maid's attention looked stupid--sort of like a subplot from an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recapture the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME, as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate (just as in the other film). I was not a huge fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film.",movie
563,"The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film from this director that I've seen, and among the very best of its genre.",movie

566,I lived during those times and I think the program caught the heart of the era. I do think it should have dealt with more of the Afro American issue but I think it cover a lot in the program. It was scary to sit and watch the riots on T V hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war. I went to school with guys who came back. Some had changed more than others and some not so much. It bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough. Live through it and then make comments. I thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job. Thank you for a trip (sad and good) down memory lane.,movie
567,"Mr. Gintis is schooled in contemporary neoclassical economics that trivializes and sometimes even denies the existence of Ricardian rent, and naturally has difficulty separating and identifying natural resource rents from other components of the economy. This is most disappointing, as substantial strides have been made in showing the amount and significance of rents since the advent of computer power and data can be tapped. Australian economist Terry Dwyer, himself Harvard educated, shows that just the ground rent from earthly locations is about a third of GDP. And Professor Gaffney's most recent article in the International Journal of Social Economics shows the numerous ways in which rent has been under-estimated. Professor Gintis gets a number of his facts wrong in this review: Henry George's Progress and Poverty was first published in 1879 and not 1987, and by 1906 had been translated into fourteen languages and sold more copies than any book published except the Bible. Contemporaries of the era were intellectual luminaries and statesmen, among them Bernard Shaw, Winston Churchill, Sun Yat Sen, Leo Tolstoi, and Alfred Russell Wallace. More recently, Illinois economics professor and later Paul Douglas was a strong supporter of these ideas, as was Albert Einstein. John Dewey wrote an introduction to one edition of Progress and Poverty, saying ""It would require less than the fingers of the two hands to enumerate those who, from Plato down, rank with Henry George among the world's social philosophers. No man, no graduate of a higher institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker."" Later, at the depth of the depression, Dewey gave a radio broadcast in homage to George. More recently still some eight Nobel laureates in economics have endorsed taxing economic rents, and Columbia University Professor Bill Vickrey was on his way to a Georgist convention when he died.Professor Gaffney's collected work spans seven decades, and he continues to be active -- his most recent book, After the Crash, is printed by Wiley Blackwell. As evidence mounts in recognition of the importance of economic rent in our contemporary economy, only those who wear blinders will continue to deny its significance. He continues to inspire many young scholars. It is fortunate that we have the benefit of Mason Gaffney's enormous corpus of articles, www.masongaffney.org, for it is now, as neoclassical economics is collapsing of its own contradictions, that the tradition of classical economics is being looked to once more. One could do far worse than to start by exploring the many Georgist websites that continue to explore and amplify this venerable tradition. Links can be found readily on Professor Gaffney's site.",book

569,"This movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film. Dolph Friggin' Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough, but add really corny buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and over-the-top villain, a clich√©d love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time, and you've got yourself quite the little suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and, up till watching ""Showdown,"" had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.<br /><br />I don't know if it's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia, and not by females, either. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other's manly parts, and in fact before going on a suicide spree, Brandon says to Dolphy, ""In case we don't make it, I want to tell you, you have the biggest d--- I've ever seen.""<br /><br />Now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? In an ACTION film no less? And would you want those to be your _dying words_??<br /><br />Later, there's this gem:<br /><br />Dolph (regarding the villain): ""I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy."" Brandon: ""Man, you've got a fixation."" <br /><br />As the guy at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out, ""Unfortunately, Dolph doesn't respond with, 'I've got a fixation? I've got a fixation?!

578,"A lot of people don't think Branagh's Hamlet film is all that good, but I must admit I think it is splendid. Like virtually every production of Shakespeare, it has problems and it has had to make hard choices, not all of which work out. The thing about the ""secret doors everywhere"", for instance, simply doesn't work. That element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to, which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming. This is the biggest problem with this production. And while it's a biggie, I'm also inclined to say that it's the only problem. Almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully. All right, so Branagh is a mite too old for the title role. And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced. And he gets too hysterical at times. But that's it. No other complaints. Even with these faults, I think this version is a seminal one, and if it's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be, it's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be. We get the complete text of the longest version of the play, innovatively and expensively brought to the screen, mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices - even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with. But in a staging of Shakespeare, it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language. For that, one must delve into the print versions of the plays.<br /><br />All the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic (incl. Jack Lemmon). Julie Christie as Gertrude is surely one of the best ever, and even the American actors are astounding, esp. Charlton Heston as the Player King - who would have thought it?! (A story is going around that Heston once played Hamlet on stage, and when a critic in the front row couldn't stand his hammy acting and said out loud, ""This is terrible!"", Heston reportedly retorted right from the stage: ""Well, I didn't write this crap!"" Of course it may not be true, but it's a funny story - and if true, a bold and ironic choice for Branagh to include Heston here.) Robin Williams as ""Young Ozric"" is perhaps not young enough for the part, but he makes it a comical one, which is warranted.<br /><br />Overall it is a very well-produced version, with most of the key scenes being, to my mind, supremely memorable. Of course, I watched this movie just as I was becoming interested in Shakespeare (and around the same time as Luhrmann's formidable Romeo+Juliet), and it made a great impression on me, which must account for some of my fondness for it.<br /><br />All things considered, I must pronounce Branagh's Hamlet to be my favorite one, with Derek Jacobi's 1980 BBC version a close second. I probably like Branagh's Shakespeare work more than most, finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer, with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text. In the world of Shakespeare acting, the two brightest luminaries remain Olivier and Branagh, and while Olivier is the superior actor, Branagh brings Shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice, and transforms it into churlish, easy-going, populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity. Branagh, I believe, brings out a truer Shakespeare than the world has yet seen.<br /><br />And so, 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous Hamlet.",movie

582,"Ironically the most talked-about American film in the 2008 New York Film Festival is 98% in Spanish. The extra-long film's controversy began at the Cannes Festival. There were love-hate notices, and considerable doubts about commercial prospects. As consolation the star, Benicio Del Toro, got the Best Actor award there. I'm talking about Steven Soderbergh's 'Che,' of course. That's the name it's going by in this version, shown in New York as at Cannes in two 2-hour-plus segments without opening title or end credits. 'Che' is certainly appropriate since Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara is in almost every scene. Del Toro is impressive, hanging in reliably through thick and thin, from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two, appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations, even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into Bolivia. It's a terrific performance; one wishes it had a better setting.<br /><br />If you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours, with an intermission between the two sections, there are rewards. There's an authentic feel throughout--fortunately Soderbergh made the decision to film in Spanish (though some of the actors, oddly enough in the English segments especially, are wooden). You get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare, Che style, was like: the teaching, the recruitment of campesinos, the morality, the discipline, the hardship, and the fighting--as well as Che's gradual morphing from company doctor to full-fledged military leader. Use of a new 9-pound 35 mm-quality RED ""digital high performance cine camera"" that just became available in time for filming enabled DP Peter Andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold, but at times still sing, and are always sharp and smooth.<br /><br />The film is in two parts--Soderbergh is calling them two ""films,"" and the plan is to release them commercially as such. First is 'The Argentine,' depicting Che's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of Havana in the late 50's, and the second is 'Guerrilla,' and concerns Che's failed effort nearly a decade later in Bolivia to spearhead a revolution, a fruitful mission that led to Guevara's capture and execution in 1967. The second part was to have been the original film and was written first and, I think, shot first. Producer Laura Bickford says that part two is more of a thriller, while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes. Yes, but both parts have a lot in common--too much--since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country. Guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the Bolivian revolt was doomed from the start. The group of Cubans who tried to lead it didn't get a friendly reception from the Bolivian campesinos, who suspected foreigners, and thought of the Cuban communists as godless rapists. There is a third part, a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che's speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time, but that is inter-cut in the first segment. The first part also has Fidel and is considerably more upbeat, leading as it does to the victory in Santa Clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.<br /><br />During 'Guerilla' I kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality European-style miniseries, which might begin with a shortened version of Walter Salles's 'Motorcycle Diaries' and go on to take us to Guevara's fateful meeting with Fidel in Mexico and enlistment in the 26th of July Movement. There could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions. This is far from a complete picture of the man, his childhood interest in chess, his lifelong interest in poetry, the books he wrote; even his international fame is only touched on. And what about his harsh, cruel side? Really what Soderbergh is most interested in isn't Che, but revolution, and guerrilla warfare. The lasting impression that the 4+ hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich. Someone mentioned being reminded of Terrence Malick's 'The Tin Red Line,' and yes, the meandering, episodic battle approach is similar; but 'The Thin Red Line' has stronger characters (hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides Che), and it's a really good film. This is an impressive, but unfinished and ill-fated, effort.<br /><br />This 8-years-gestating, heavily researched labor of love (how many more Ocean's must come to pay for it?) is a vanity project, too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries. Radical editing--or major expansion--would have made it into something more successful, and as it is it's a long slog, especially in the second half.<br /><br />It's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down, though it's not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken--but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one.",movie

587,"Believe it or not, this Burger King, which I've lived near for the past 20 years and was always an afterthought (at best) in my mind, now holds a special place in my heart (and my wife's heart) because the food from this location was the first thing we ate after getting married. And it was completely unplanned and impromptu too. Crazy.

Our formal wedding ceremony and reception was originally scheduled for May 30, 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we postponed the festivities about a year. However, in part because we wanted to preserve the date, we still got married legally that day (a week ago today: https://www.yelp.com/biz/fulton-county-probate-court-main-office-atlanta). Talk about a strange time to get married. Not only was the ceremony super small, quick, and socially distant with masks worn, but the City of Atlanta was dealing with protests, riots, and unrest with beefed-up law enforcement on the streets, roads blocked off, choppers flying overhead, and curfews enacted by Mayor Bottoms (props to her).

After the ceremony and marriage license signing, we just wanted to get home, but we were also hungry. I like McDonald's so we went to the McDonald's next door to this Burger King. For some reason, the drive-thru at McDonald's was backed up so I, along with the car behind me, drove to this Burger King instead. That's how we ended up here. In all my years of regularly visiting the McDonald's next door, on my wedding day, they finally let me down.

I know I've been to this Burger King at least once, but it was a long time ago and I was not impressed. I believe I visited in the early-to-mid 2000s, either when I was a student at Georgia Tech or shortly after graduating. I recall hearing this Burger King was/is owned by Magic Johnson, but I haven't confirmed. So, it took me a good 15 to 20 years to come back here and still, it wasn't my top choice.

For our first meal as a married couple, I ordered us two #1 combo meals, large size. Each meal came with a BK Whopper, fries, and large drink. We both chose Coke for our drink. This rang up to $14.16 after tax ($7.08 per person). I used the drive-thru. While at the window, I saw a masked customer ordering at the counter inside. I'm not sure if that meant the dining room was open or not. The worker helping the customer at the counter was *not* wearing a mask. I thought it was a state requirement for all restaurant workers to wear masks. Our drive-thru cashier was wearing a mask, but she had it pushed down onto her chin, defeating the purpose of the mask.

The food was surprisingly good. It hit the spot, but we were admittedly very hungry too. My wife commented that it was the best Burger King she's had in a while, better than our BK experience at the North Ave location last year: https://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-king-atlanta-15. I agree with her and we weren't being sentimental or letting the ""day"" affect our opinion. We had a lot of other things on our mind and food wasn't one of them. This meal was for sustenance. I didn't even take pictures of it! If you know me, then you'll probably find that shocking. The burgers definitely had that appetizing, flame-grilled taste and we enjoyed the ingredients like lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles. I still love the Big Mac, but the Whopper feels more substantial, meatier, and ""real"" to me. The fries were good. The meal was filling and kept me going for the rest of the day and night.

Congratulations, Burger King store #2137 at 1122 Northside Dr NW in Atlanta, GA 30318. You've made history (in our lives).",restaurant

596,"The protagonist in this story by Ray Bradbury, was a fireman named Guy Montag. The main antagonist was Captain Beatty who was the chief of the firemen. The story takes place in the future in a city like any other today. The only difference is that everything is run by computers and books are illegal to read and own. Unlike today, where firemen stop fires, their job was to burn books and houses they were in. It did not matter if there people in them or not. As the story developes, Montag becomes curious about what the prohibited books contain, so he steals them. Towards the end of the book he gets caught and becomes a fugitive. Although the book has a good message, it was extremely boring. It made us reflect on our own lifestyles, yet we didn't enjoy the way Bradbury wrote it. It was dry and basically boring. Yet the theme about finding our humanity and ourselves was eye opening. It made us wonder if our civilization will end up as Bradbury's novel depicts. Will we end up, so wrapped up in ourselves and our technology that we will no longer have time to love others and have a mind of our own?

The film's running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie. The visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that. However, there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals. The film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary. I blame director and writer Kerry Conran. He focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story. The movie is like a girl with no personality, after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring. Sky Captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality. It's simply just another case of style over substance.<br /><br />The acting is surprisingly average and that's not really their fault since they had very little to work with. The main reason I watched this movie is because of Angelina Jolie. However, the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes. Her performance is surprisingly bland as well. Jude Law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him. Gwyneth Paltrow was just average, nothing special at all. Ling Bai's performance was the only one I really liked. She gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film.<br /><br />The movie is not a complete bust though. There were some ""wow"" and exciting scenes. There just weren't enough of them. The film just doesn't have that hook to really make it memorable. It was actually quite bland and it wasn't very engaging at all. It's too bad the film wasn't very good since it had such a promising premise. In the end, Sky Captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching. Rating 4/10",movie

599,"This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it. She wasn't. I'm a gal, I watched this film with two guys, and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.<br /><br />WARNING: PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!<br /><br />The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out, and sure enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend, aided by the wishy-washy one, sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (Remember the movie's title?) So now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.<br /><br />She's already broken off relations with her girlfriends, because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy (nice, huh?), but now she tells him she'll marry him, and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home, where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene, they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be smug. I kid you not, it's that bad. I left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment.",movie
600,"I had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer,the end result was just two scenes in the movie. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the wagon,stop the wagon etc . So this Dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real. (yes Doris, animals were hurt during filming) I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in the Shining? A great western/social comment from the 50's. This should be in the same class as High Noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause was for 50's youth.",movie

Margaret Hamilton good as always; smaller part than in ""Wizard of Oz"". Spring Byington way prettier, also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by Hamilton. Tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious. As a two year veteran of Army tents, he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes.<br /><br />I used to work in a department store, and it was just as elegant as this one. Sadly, it has disappeared and faded into obscurity.

603,"The story of the boy thief of Bagdad (as it was once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of ""Thief of Bagdad,"" to less imposing, more recent attempts. The best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. Those effects still work their charm.<br /><br />No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.<br /><br />Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt. Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.<br /><br />Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.)<br /><br />Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. Still, I don't think anyone under eight ought to see ""Thief of Bagdad.""<br /><br />This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. It was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.<br /><br />""Thief of Bagdad"" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind.<br /><br />9/10.",movie

609,"""Masters of Horror"" has proved itself a poor arena for 'message episodes,' and while a definite case can be made for Joe Dante's 'Screwfly Solution' (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most efforts to do so have come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive (nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox). And 'Pro-Life' simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence; young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), seen running through the woods, is nearly hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who just happen to be driving in to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a stone-cold, far-right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. If for nothing else, 'Pro-Life' accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue, but John Carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference--he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); the slow pacing builds no tension, and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl. Even when Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, guns blazing, it is a stunning non-event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion,' the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary--an effort to pad out the underwritten film. The poor performances (Perlman is sadly wasted here) become an outgrowth of the script, and Carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if 'Pro-Life' is the source of his next hot meal. By the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking...",movie

I wish these were my problems. I do enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for Sinise. The scene in which little Timmy Price gets verbally abused by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so over the top that i am embarrassed to watch it,movie

Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex, kik, Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, Alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.Ending up was sad.<br /><br />The director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theatre on Sunday 12:00PM on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate.<br /><br />On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, I don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.<br /><br />The two main reasons I don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film didn't have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what I was waiting for¬Ö¬Ö. However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The ""ear piercing "" part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love. Also, the scene of they were lying in the soccer field, the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate.",movie

618,"I bought this (a) because I had wanted to read about snow leopards and (b) because the cover of the edition I have indicates it won both the American Book Award and the National Book Award. Well, it's not about snow leopards--at least not in the 80 pages I could manage to slog through--but no one promised me it would be, so fair enough.What the book seems to be is a series of shallow meditations hung on a metaphoric frame of a journey. The ostensible topic of the writing is Buddhism and sundry ""eastern"" forms of religious belief and mysticism(s): the things Matthiessen writes about, however, are actually mid-20th century Western translations of or interpretations of ""Eastern 'philosophy'."" At least in the pages I read, he has nothing interesting to relate about these topics.The prose is not particularly smooth, but it does not really intrude on the reading experience. What does intrude, however, and annoy, is the overuse of allusions to other literary works and the many attempts buttress poor thinking and analysis with poorly thought out interpretations of results of research in (obviously misunderstood) other areas. (Whenever writers who are not physicists start alluding to developments in 20th century physics, you can be pretty sure they don't know either physics or the topic at hand.)Now, note well that I quit reading the book: maybe I am completely wrong, and the author's intent was to have the experience of reading the book reproduce a difficult spiritual journey, with the boring, unrewarding, pointless slogging coming first and the payoff later. I skimmed later sections of the book, however, and didn't see any hints of a payoff.Don't bother with this book.",book
619,"I don't know what has happened to director Abel Ferrara. Ever since the ""Body Snatchers"" remake he seems to have lost it. ""King of New York"" and ""The Bad Lieutenant"" remain two of the best films of the '90s: searing indictments of a decade gone wrong. With films like ""'R Xmas"" (whatever that means) and ""New Rose Hotel"" he seems determined to disgust and bore his former supporters. This film has NO LIFE in it. While he gets excellent performances out of his actors in all of his projects the result of this mishmash of ideas just doesn't jell.

As the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay. Like ""Drunken Master,"" ""Police Story"" has many of the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that Chan has become famous for, climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan exceeds in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action.

Years before, Shana &amp; Lily were raped and although the rapist was found and jailed, he is out again and on the war-path, stalking Shana (as he knows where she lives!)Lily is coming to terms with protecting her daughter and rekindling the romance that she has with another defence lawyer, Richard.Basically, Lily, Shana, Richard and John (her ex) are very annoying people.

This is his story for a year in eastern Kentucky as the mountain ""is removed.""This is not just another tale of woe about Big Coal, about coal mining or about mining in general. Reece knows that mining is here to stay, whether it is coal, copper, iron, nickel or bauxite.The focus here is on a special type of mining: mountaintop removal and valley fills. This type of mining came into being in the early 1990's when massive, powerful equipment and the technology to support it made this type of mining possible.This type of mining has the capability to destroy the topography of planet Earth. Our descendants, hundreds and thousands of years from now will still be living with the effects of mountain top removal and valley fills.The fact that the central and southern Appalachian Mountains are for now, the mountain range most affected by this type of mining holds a special irony. The Appalachians are one of the oldest mountain ranges on earth. The mix of flora and fauna has evolved over a long period of time. A rich mix of species includes more species of salamander, more species of bats, birds, butterflies, fish than any other place in the United States.Mountain top removal and valley fills destroy the land. Trees and vegetation get stripped and removed. The rich,layered soil gets dumped, along with broken-up rock into ravines and valleys where it blocks springs, intermittent streams, vernal pools and bogs.

635,"I see all these complaints about the soap box of the author... Cha... That is the point of reading, to engage the mind! Now when a movie does that well, yes, that is irritating, when an author invites you to examine the way you think through his story he has done his job. Now if the characters don't generate your interest, sympathy, or antipathy, then you won't continue to read. Then you will have changed the way the author writes, or he/she will go broke.That being said, I think that certain members of congress, and senate, not to mention our allies, could stand some of the preaching in this story. Now while I will admit, that some of the writing seems to be dumbed down, and that some is way too gruesome, (the whole details on the Mord Sith I could have done without), and it would be infinitely more readable, if the author would take a class in being concise (it seems like he might get paid by the page sometimes), I have enjoyed each of the stories and started on each one since the third, the week they come out. And finally, as to the Jordan comparison, the wheel of time and the Sword of truth stories are basically the same story, no doubt about it. Guess what? The sword of Truth stories are better, precisely because of the preaching. So there you go.Update 2008If you are reading this in 2008 and the series is finished, be warned that a lot of the things I liked about this story became worn and tiresome by the time the story finishes with Confessor. If you are a speed reader, you still may want to read this saga, but if you aren't by the time you finish Faith of the Fallen, you may have had enough.Here's my ADHD recap.Freedom is good, evil men despise freedom, love to torture, and will do all kinds of kinky disgusting things.If you go to the fan site for the stories you can get a list of the wizard's rules which are pretty good and food for thought.

After finally getting a drink order in I noticed the bartender was slurring her words and dropping glasses. While waiting for my drink to be made, I noticed other staff members were under influence. Even heard a server say just how drunk the others were. Other patrons at the bar were not being attended to and were leaving for lack of customer service. I did not receive my first drink until 35 min after from sitting at the bar. Completely unprofessional service, being someone the has worked in the industry, the incoherence from multiple staff members from being under the influences unacceptable! There was left over food, signed receipts, used glasses all over the bar which had not been cleaned for the entire duration I was there. (2hours) The bar backs were drunk, cooks were drunk, bartender couldn't stand up straight, slurring her words (Katie), and most of the time she was away from the bar area doing God nows what leaving the bar empty. None were serving guests at a timely manner nor doing their job. Customers were walking out and you can see the anger in customers' faces from the customer service we were receiving. And it seemed as if there was no manager on the floor to control any of this. The person that did make my drink since Katie was too drunk to, made it loud and clear he was off the clock, drunk, and worked at the Seaworld location and thought the whole situation was funny. I even tried to put in a food order, didn't even get to do that since no one wanted to work and attend to the guests. I will not be back.",restaurant
642,"Ever since I first played it in 1998, GoldenEye has been one of my favourite video games. In fact, I recently bought an N64 purely so that I could own it and play it more often! The game is pretty much near-perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in Bond's shoes, with varied mission objectives, convincing weapons, and great level design. Even though the enemies' artificial intelligence is pretty basic by today's standards, that only adds to GoldenEye's appeal. The method of obtaining cheats (completing levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now I still haven't cracked some of them!<br /><br />The game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while this isn't as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the game's sequel ""Perfect Dark"", it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of RC-P90 fire! ;-)",movie

657,"I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers.<br /><br />Part 1: <br /><br />No, this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know, the one where everybody is a racist, and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. Race.<br /><br />Its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race.<br /><br />Paul Haggis made a movie which took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected, and then screwed it into a 1'53"" mental vomit about racism in America. RACE. In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. The first hour, people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America.<br /><br />For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad, the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM. Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where, instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY. <br /><br />The other good thing about it is the Mexican story when the Mexican guy is talking to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. Decent writing, but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place.<br /><br />The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. The Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anybody act like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. ""Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly."" If i ever watch the second half of the movie, I hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish.<br /><br />I haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then, there is the black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing, and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers wife, could I help it if I was cracking up? When Philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism, can I help but crack up? The movie is so funny when it is being racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you.<br /><br />Now, mind you, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Editing, besides a nod to Matt Dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. Who was paid off for that one, I have no clue.<br /><br />Don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form.<br /><br />D- <br /><br />Part 2:<br /><br />The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive, conclusionary, the world is a big coincidence kind of way. And it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it.<br /><br />Take 1999's Magnolia. People weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. Crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme.<br /><br />The stories are lined up so everybody meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working weird shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And, why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional tension, as well as realism, if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? Like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everybody'd be freaking out.<br /><br />Eventually, in the second half, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. It really ticked me off. At the writers, not the scene.<br /><br />The whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. The coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia which was connected mildly, this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over-the-top. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die though. She should have. I cheered when she fell.<br /><br />The worst part about the movie is it pulls a Magnolia. Not just in structure, but it has a montage over the song In the Deep where you see everybody being depressed. Magnolia took this and had post-modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. Its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow.<br /><br />Utter waste of my time.<br /><br />First half: D-; Second half: lowest grade ever; Overall: F---",movie

662,"I don't know anything of the writer's or the director's earlier work so I hadn't brought any prejudices to the film. Based on the brief description of the plot in TV Guide I thought it might be interesting.<br /><br />But implausibility was piled upon implausibility. Each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed, gruesome makeup, or special effects.<br /><br />The score was professional and Kari Wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing. It was positively repulsive.<br /><br />I will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but I'll give an example of what I think of as an excess of explicit gore.<br /><br />Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim (Wendt) out of the deep freeze. McKenna had killed Wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck. Now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's demise. (What are the cops going to do, measure his bite radius?) McKenna unwraps Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag it's in, takes an ax, and begins to chop off Wendt's head. Whack. Whack. Whack. The bit of the ax keeps chipping away at Wendt's neck. The air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh, one of which drops on McKenna's head. (He brushes it off when he's done.) McKenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he's built. He sits the head on the ground, squats next to it, takes out some photos of a woman he's just killed, and shows them to Wendt's head. ""Remember her? We could have really made it if it hadn't been for you guys,"" he tells the head. ""Duke, you've always liked bonfires, haven't you?"" he asks. Then he places the head on the fire. We only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame.<br /><br />I don't want this sort of garbage to be censored. I'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff.<br /><br />There's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie. Well, I'll mention one example of an ""implausibility,"" since I brought the idea up. McKenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack. He knows he's going to be clobbered half to death in the following days. (He's literally invited the heavies to do it.) What would you do in this Poe-like situation? Here's what McKenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life. He finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates (successfully). Give that man the Medal of Freedom! <br /><br />A monster who looks like Pizza the Hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often hand held and wobbly. The dialog has lines like, ""Life is a piece of s***. Or else it's the best of all possible worlds. It depends on your point of view."" Use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. A house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero, McKenna, walks towards us in the foreground.<br /><br />Some hero he is, too. He first kills a man for $13,000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body. (This bothers him a little, but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment.) Then, I hope I have the order straight, he kills Wendt by ripping out part of his neck. Then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it, although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it. Next he burns the head honcho (Baldwin) alive. Then, having disabled the two lesser heavies, he deliberately blows them up, though one of them isn't entirely unsympathetic. And we're supposed to be rooting for McKenna.<br /><br />These aren't cartoon deaths like those in the Dirty Harry movies either -- bang bang and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first one -- the murder for $13,000 -- is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life. It isn't really easy to kill another human being, as Hitchcock had demonstrated in Torn Curtain. But that scene leads to no place of any importance.<br /><br />Some people might enjoy this, especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies. Some meretricious stuff on screen here.",movie

669,"After reading the other reviews, I was interested in the range of responses to it. Some enjoyed it as a fast summer read, others connected to its historical detail.I was fascinated with the way characters were developed, even though I early on figured out (as did at least one other reader) the identities of the killer and the hacker. But that only enhanced the way the book led me through the behavior of each character.Perez-Reverte understands, as does Umberto Eco in &quot;Name of the Rose,&quot; that a Grand Inquisitor has a personality which depends for satisfaction on the status of his victims. The Inquisition lives on in such lost souls. P-R also shows understanding of cowardice in an all too common form: abuse of the helpless for entertainment. He holds a lens to the vincible evil of the old banker who gives his regular shoe shine man payment with a denomination of money for which he knows the fellow cannot make change. The old banker enjoys a helpless person's humiliation for an honest bit of labor.The author is kind enough to allow readers to find similar subtle gems of insight set into the manuscript. What some reviewers saw as &quot;comic relief&quot; of the bungling local spies, I saw as a portrait of incompetent, invincible evil. The trio of self-deceiving never-have-beens incapable of facing their insignificance required no response from those trying to preserve an old church as a haven.I was entertained until the last sentence (anticlimactic for me) by the way those who sought good consequences for others (preservation of a place of solace and peace) chose not to be distracted to despair by mindful cruelties and idiocies drifting around them.The choices made by strong, good souls reminded me of the remarks Solzhenitsyn makes in his &quot;D&eacute;tente: Prospects for Democracy and Dictatorship&quot; when he says that those who wish the world well should not &quot;make concessions to senseless, immoral aggressors&quot; and should &quot;find others of good will&quot; until there! is a critical mass of firm, caring people. In this sense, &quot;Seville Communion&quot; has many layers of meaning. The surface layer is the defense of a simple place of solace in communion. Behind this surface is a realm where those who wish the world well find satisfaction in their own spiritual strength to keep alive a process of liberation.",book
670,"Have you ever fantasized about the possibility ofbecoming president of the United States? Have you felt youcould do the job at least as well as the folks who have heldit in the past few decades, if not better? Perhaps you havewondered what day-to-day life must be like in the WhiteHouse. It looks pretty plush, but what would it be like toactually live there? Or perhaps you wander what the secretservice folks are really like?If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you aregoing to love Executive Orders. The novel begins where Debtof Honor left off, and Jack Ryan (through a series of eventsI won't reveal, since some of you may not have read theprevious book yet) is now President. And as always, he facesa bowl full of crises, enough to destroy most men.Let's see. He has to deal with a new Arab country, theUnited Islam Republic, created when Iran's latest leaderarranges for the assassination of Sudam Hussein and takesover that country. China's leaders also start things goingwhen they provoke a dogfight with some of Taiwan's fighterplanes and shoot down a civilian airliner in the process.Then Ed Kealty, the model of a corrupt politician, tries toquestion Ryan's authority as president, and begins to leaksome of the secret missions in which Ryan had participatedwhile in the CIA (and which Clancy wrote about in earlierbooks). Appealing to our fears about biological warfare, afew new cases of Ebola, the most deadly modern virus,suddenly spread to our own country. And to keep hisattention sharp, there are assassination attempts on bothhimself and his family.As always, Clancy jumps from scene to scene, perhapsmore than ever. It is well done, however, and helps to buildsuspense. Thus the events which make up one sub-plot mayextend for several hundred pages.Interestingly enough, this book has not gotten goodreviews from many of Clancy's readers. They argue that itcontains a lot of irrelevant material, particularly in hispolitical exposition. Admittedly he does push his particularphilosophy; there is no hidden agenda, however, for hededicates the book to Ronald Reagan, (the man who won thewar) and many of his ideas are similar to Reagan's and hisfollowers. I felt, however, that this was an important partof the book, for Ryan is not a professional politician, anda main thrust of the novel is his attempt to bring commonsense to the problems that face our nation. I might notalways agree with his solutions, but they were quiteconsistent with his character.It is also fun to wonder What if . . . He wants tosimplify the tax code, for example, by doing away with alltax exemptions and using a flat percentage tax that wouldapply to all income levels. This, President Ryan argues,would bring in just as much income from the rich folks whonow use the complexity of the current code to exempt much oftheir income. It would also have the side affect of doingaway with many of the accountants and attorneys whospecialize in tax law (a benefit that I suspect some of ouraccountants and attorneys might not see).I recommend this book, though I also suggest you readDebt of Honor first to get the background.

671,"I had never heard of Leos Carax until his Merde segment in last years Tokyo, and his was easily the stand-out the film's three stories. It wasn't my favorite of the shorts, but it was the most unique, and the most iconic. ""The Lovers on the Bridge"" was the first of his full length features I've seen, a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic. Though he's classified as a neo-nouvelle vogue, his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60's experimental narratives. His movies are closer to Jean Vigo in ""L'atlante"", Jean Cocteau, and Guy Maddin, than Godard and Truffaut.<br /><br />In Boy Meets Girl Carax's 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states. He combines the exaggerated worlds of Maddin, but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like Cocteau, but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible, emotional, and engaging like Vigo's movies.<br /><br />The story of Boy Meets Girl is simple, and similar to Carax's two following films which comprise this ""Young lovers"" trilogy. A boy named Alex played by Denis Lavant (who plays a character named Alex in Carax's next two movies), has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend. In the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder. He walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex, and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate. He steals records for her and leaves them at his friend's apartment, but avoids contacting either of them directly. He wanders around and finds his way to a party, where he meets a suicidal young woman, and the film becomes part ""Breathless"" and part ""Limelight"".<br /><br />Later he is advised by an old man with sign language to ""speak up for yourself...young people today It's like they forgot how to talk."" The old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film, and how an actor timid off stage became a confident ""lion"" when in front of the camera. Heres where the movie tips its hand, but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene, since it overlaps the style of the film (silent and expressionist), with the content (a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to). Though Alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end, he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which aren't easy to nail down from moment to moment, aside from a desire to fall in love.<br /><br />There is a scene in the film where Alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies, all crying in a chorus that fills that room, until he turns on a tape of a children's show making them fall silent. Unexpectedly due a glitch the TV ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses. Even as Carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell (the room full of whining infants), he's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses. Even the rich old, bell of the ball has a brother she misses. In another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence.<br /><br />Though indebted to films before talkies, Carax is a master of music, knowing when to pipe in the Dead Kennedy's ""Holiday in Cambodia"", or an early David Bowie song, the sounds of a man playing piano, or of a girl softly humming.<br /><br />In Boy Meets Girl, when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt, when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel, when Alex enters a party an feels out of place, its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance; like the famous author who can't speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain, or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut. This film is the missing link between Jean Piere Jenuet, Michel Gondry, and Wes Anderson, whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy, all have a parallel with different visuals, musical, and emotional cues in these Carax movies.<br /><br />Every line of dialog, every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level, some I lack words to articulate. There are many tales of a boy meeting a girl, but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment. The other movies you want to watch can wait. See this first. If I were to make films, I would want them to be like this, in fact I wish all films were like this, where the ephemeral becomes larger than life, and life itself becomes a dream.",movie
672,"This was a sordid and dreary mess. I needed a shower when it was over. It goes something like this- some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which reveals much about Hollywood and its psychosis about women). What's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky. Ellen Barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective, and Julian Sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross-dressing psychiatrist, which is why it escapes a one-star rating.",movie

I chose the lefse (the Nordic equivalent of a crepe) and the stew special (so worth the dairy pills and exposure to my cow dairy allergen lol). You could taste the chef's love--something of an important ingredient, expressed through tenderness in the beef shortribs, with ""winter vegetables""--delicate mushrooms, crunchy pickled carrots, in a perfectly textured gravy of wine, dill, and half and half.

677,"With Cry, The Beloved Country Alan Paton creates a world were hate is predominant and respect is required of all native African citizens for their white &quot;superiors.&quot; Paton creates a novel that plays out so true to life, so full of compassion for its characters, and so full of heart-ache is can bring one to tears.The novel focuses on its protaganist, an aging African minister named Stephen Kumalo, who is on a quest to find his son Absalom in the big city (the largest in Africa at the time I belive) Johannesburg. Here he searches all over, but only in vain, for the places where his son has resided, but his son has already departed from them. But its in Johannesburg where Reverend Kumalo discovers his sister and her son, his brother (a carpenter come political activist), and other characters that range from a fellow pastor to the father of a son who has been murdered.Cry, the Beloved Country, reads like many ancient texts oddly enough, and some readers may find it difficult to keep up with because Paton uses no quotation marks to signify dialogue, but nonetheless Cry, the Beloved Country is a captivating novel that reaches into one's soul and explains the boundaries of compassion, and the meaning of friendship even in the most trying of times.",book

I saw this film last night in Menerbes, France-we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente for the showing-crammed in. Polite, patient, genial. Although my French is testy, I got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the ""old"" terror growers interviewed-esp. the one from a communist village in Languedoc. He got a lot of laughs. This is unusual in France-laughing aloud. There is no question which side of the terror-globalization war they are on! SM",movie

Of her era and ilk, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What was it about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint.

691,"I found Right Use of Will one of the most transformative texts I've ever read. Earth Spell is the 4th of the series. I have been reading them in order and I like Earth Spell the least of the four I've read so far. It's hard to say whether this has more to do with the channeler's biases, or if it's something to do with me--perhaps I'm too guilt-ridden, ""gapped,"" and altogether flawed to understand and move my triggered emotions.I think Earth Spell could have benefited from some serious editing--both making it much more concise and also clearing up who is being addressed in any given paragraph. It keeps talking about all the things ""you"" did and are doing and how deluded you are if you think your new age claptrap is going to save you, etc....and I'm not sure if he's talking about me personally, or the Angels, Lucifer...? I guess you aren't supposed to edit God...but I think this book could have perhaps reached a larger audience with some cleanup and organization of the text, which is rambling, extremely repetitive, and with a slightly nasty tone throughout.The first book, Right Use of Will, was much more helpful in terms of practical suggestions for self-change. These balanced out the fear-triggers, of which there were many. Earth Spell, on the other hand, is really low on the practical suggestions and high on the fear-triggers. The book makes it seem nearly impossible to succeed in changing oneself enough to not get swept up in what sounds like death or loveless Hell for most people on the planet. And it makes it sound like it's your own fault you're so flawed because no matter what you chose, you chose wrong...I'm not really sure regarding what. It's particularly frustrating being told these things because definitions are so unclear, so it's hard to understand exactly what the book is talking about.I'm going to read the next three just because I have them, but I feel less enthused about the series as I continue to read it.Update: I began by giving the book 2 stars, but I've upgraded it to 3 stars because as the information has percolated, I feel I've gotten more from it--maybe the repetition of its essential message--that what you dislike in others, you dislike in yourself--is necessary to really hammer it in, and the endless presentation of all the things God and others did to create lost will is useful as a series of archetypes one can use to recognize similar situations in one's own life.",book
692,"Do not see this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective viewing, me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course. The only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer.<br /><br />Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. I realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion, this movie has bred a deep hatred within me. I hate this movie so very, very much.<br /><br />Some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If only it didn't take itself seriously. But it does. The plot is a warmed over version of Blade Runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg isn't even trying, but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like fingernails on the soul. And whether its Juliet Landua with her off again on again British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the blustering Commissioner, you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment.<br /><br />I recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall.",movie

694,"All through his career Hitchcock did great films; this was not one of them.<br /><br />A man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence, and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen 1930s Fritz Lang films- 'M' comes to mind- will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time. There is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace, darkness, and depravity that Hitchcock might have been seeking to instil.<br /><br />What it is worth watching out for, however, is the sequence associated with the shooting at the Albert Hall. Once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion. The camerawork is lively, the cuts are interesting, and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly. Here you can see the future master: Hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect: when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it.",movie

It was completed 7 minutes after I arrived and then the girl in front of me got her order taken. One drink. I then waited ANOTHER 5 minutes to be acknowledged when her drink was done.

700,"Great service from Amazon in U.S.I was not familiar with this book nor with the excellent writer, Barbara Tuchman. It's a fabulous book and everyone in Europe, the Americas, and the rest of the world should read it. It should be required reading for all advanced secondary school students. The powerful message it conveys is that men with power will expect that others should give their all to keep them in power. For several million human beings it meant the supreme sacrifice. They gave their lives in an insane 4 year war that coerced the leaders of too many nations into blindly diving in. Their countries, their people, their intellects, their economies suffered horribly. And perhaps the worst result occurred some 20 years later in a more devastating, disastrous war that resulted in the deaths of some 60 million mortals. Barbara Tuchman clearly shows us how fallacious pride and thinking can cause such disaster to so much of the world's people. Tuchman makes it painfully clear that the suffering and loss are incomprehensible.",book
701,"Deceptively short and simply written, John Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; actually offers any reader quite a lot to think about. The relationship between the two main characters highlights a number of issues relating to the themes of mental illness and friendship. The story takes place in Depression-era California. Lennie is a very large, strong man, but not too bright. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body, but because he fails to comprehend his own strength, he frequently does harm to others without meaning to. He loves to pet soft things, like mice and rabbits and puppies, and then becomes distraught when they die, not understanding that he has been too rough with them. Lennie's companion is the brains of the pair, a small man by the name of George. He fills the role of both caretaker and friend to Lennie, and does his best to keep him out of trouble, though he doesn't always succeed.The two men are traveling laborers, moving around as the availability of work dictates. To keep Lennie motivated and obedient, George pacifies him with stories of a future bright with luxury and free from worry. They'll buy a small farm, he tells his avid companion, and live off the fat of the land. They'll have their own crops and their own livestock, and go to shows whenever they feel like it. And if Lennie stays out of trouble, he can even have some rabbits of his own to take care of. Captivated by this vision, Lennie does his honest best to obey George and avoid doing anything that might jeopardize their dream. But his best just isn't good enough, and just when their plans look like they might actually be falling into place, Lennie makes the biggest bungle of all, leaving George with an extremely hard decision to make.One of the social problems Steinbeck seems to be commenting on here is the place of the mentally ill or impaired in society. What was their place at this point in time? Did they even have a place? This story makes it clear that there really weren't many avenues open to the mentally ill at the time. They could be institutionalized, but such places had little merit during the 1930s, when mental illness was not yet really understood. Patients were treated little, if at all, better than criminals. The other option would be for such people to try to get along in the outside world of &quot;normal&quot; people, as Lennie does. When Lennie's Aunt Clara dies, he is left with no family and so falls in with George, who becomes his new guardian. But the outside world is no more understanding of Lennie's handicaps than the doctors of the time, and provides countless pitfalls of its own.The other major theme of the story is friendship. What is true friendship? To what extent does one have responsibility to a friend, and what does this responsibility entail? This is something George must struggle with every day. He feels obligated to care for Lennie and help keep him out of trouble, though he clearly realizes that his own life would be far simpler if he were on his own. In the end, when Lennie commits the ultimate, irredeemable blunder, George must sort through this inner conflict to decide what is best for both of them. Should he continue to protect his companion, or should he save his own skin? And if he chooses to put Lennie's best interests first, what course of action would be the most just? The conclusion he arrives at is both intricately complex and, in another light, quite obviously simple at the same time.Aside from these two overriding themes, Steinbeck also gives us glimpses into other issues of the time, among them racism and labor conditions. On the farm where the bulk of the story takes place, one of the characters is a black stable hand. Nicknamed &quot;Crooks&quot; because of his crooked back, this man is estranged from the rest of the workers (all white). The only one who fails to comprehend why Crooks should be treated any differently than anyone else is Lennie, whose simple mind doesn't grasp the idea of racism. We also see what life was like for Depression-era vagrants, moving from place to place in search of work. The living conditions were not ideal (though those in this story are far from the worst imaginable), the food provided often lacked proper nourishment, and employers could treat their hired help in just about any way they pleased. After all, the laborers were lucky to find any paying work at all. Even if they didn't like the conditions, where else could they go?I'd definitely recommend this book to any reader. Though times have changed somewhat, the issues Steinbeck comments on are still very relevant today. The ideas presented in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; are many and deep, and much time can (and should) be spent contemplating them, but the book remains very accessible. It is a very short story, and can easily be read in one day. The style of writing is simple and direct, while retaining detail and a startling depth of feeling. However, it is by no means a feel-good story, so don't read this one at a time when you're already down in the dumps. While the ending has a very nice sense of resolution, and one is left feeling that George made the best decision he could under the circumstances (or, at least, this is the feeling I was left with), it is still rather depressing.",book

705,"Must every good story be ""improved"" with added corny Broadway music? Apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, as it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out, and this was a great example of just that... So of course, take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Fetch me a basin.<br /><br />The four stars in my rating come from casting, which I could liken to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of, but then they must go and have them sing (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of Oliver Reed (pardon if I'm mistaken, it's been a while).<br /><br />My biggest complaint I've stated. Why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story? Seldom has this been done to good effect. Generally it ruins the story. It did with this one.

I watch movies when I do not have the time or feel like going through 16-30 episodes. Movies are seem to be rushed and if you do not watch carefully, you may miss something. <br /><br />I do feel this one was rushed and I had to rewind a few parts to try and find what I missed, especially towards at the end. If you like nice love stories, I still think this is cute, and if yo have the extra time, I still think this is worth watching.<br /><br />It is always nice to go back follow the actors in different movies as we do not get to follow them from when they begin, as we do the actors producers and directors in our own countries.",movie

713,"D.W. Griffith could have made any film he wanted to after the enormous financial success of 'The Birth of a Nation'; he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date, 'Intolerance.' He took a risk with such innovations in film montage and form, and the well-known financial train wreck resulted. Buster Keaton doesn't take that kind of a risk with 'Three Ages,' a parody of 'Intolerance.' This is Keaton's first feature-length film of his own (he only acted in 'The Saphead'). He had the fallback plan of dividing the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts, which Griffith did do with 'Intolerance.' Keaton didn't have to. Chaplin had already succeeded with feature-length comedies, so if Keaton was taking a risk here, it was completely calculated.<br /><br />Chaplin had already done a parody of another film, too, with 'Burlesque on Carmen' (1915). Keaton appears to allude to that film, as well. The wrestling scene in the Ancient Rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in Chaplin's film. The comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same, too. Furthermore, Chaplin's film imitated the glossy style of DeMille's 'Carmen,' and Chaplin's film seemed a tribute to that film. Keaton doesn't attempt the radical editing, narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody, but it seems respectful of 'Intolerance' nonetheless. At least, the stories aren't told completely straightforward as in other post-'Intolerance' films, such as Dreyer's 'Leaves from Satan's Book' (Blade af Satans bog, 1921) and Fritz Lang's 'Destiny' (Der M√ºde Tod, 1921). There is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes.<br /><br />Where Keaton did take risks, however, is in his physical, daredevil comedy. That's Keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode. Reportedly, he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again. And, it wasn't just Keaton who took risks; the anachronistic baseball gag, for example, was rather dangerous. Thus, although in a different way, Keaton, like Griffith, took risks with his big film. And, I think they both succeeded.",movie

I got a hoagie and was able to mix and match the cookies -- I got M&M and chocolate chip. Then you choose an ice cream flavor. Depending on the person making your hoagie, you're able to choose more than one ice cream flavor. During two separate visits, one person allowed me to mix and match both cookies and ice cream. However, another visit, the employee allowed me to mix and match the cookies, but not the ice cream flavor. They do provide ice cream flavor sampling in the event that you're stuck between two flavors. 

The hoagie was difficult to eat as they give generous ice cream portions. The cookies were harder than I expected making it difficult to bite into; eventually, the cookie broke into pieces.",restaurant
716,"I've spent a year deployed in Iraq, and amongst the hundreds of movies I've seen here was this little gem called Vampire Assassin. Judging from the cover (African-American with corn-rows with a curved blade, leather coat and the demeanor of a badass), I expected a Blade rip-off. Fair enough.<br /><br />So I pop it in and observed a borderlined overweight African-American with no blade, no cornrows and, well, nothing at all really except...I don't know. If you've read any of these other reviews, you get the gist of the flick. It sucks. Bad. Really bad.<br /><br />I don't know if it was the Highlander-esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire, or the karate-kick sound effects for camera zooms, or the twenty dollar budget on props, or the ""ok, we have 90 minutes to film this before we're caught filming in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot,"" or the martial arts that is as exciting and fast-paced as two old people having sex, or the 7th grade acting talent, or the eccentric Asian Master who's either senial or on acid, or what, but the movie manages to force you to question your existence. And that's awesome.<br /><br />Not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like Scanners. If you heckle (or MST3K) with your friends, this is the flick for you. I've seen it three times already, and I think it might've caused permanent damage on my psyche. If you STILL don't have any clue as to the quality of the film, people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it. Not even by force.<br /><br />Long story short, watch it.

Idk about you but dog pee/poop is not something I want to be smelling while I eat. Also, there were several dog fights because all the dog owners are too drunk to tend to their animals. On top of that, prior to getting there I called about the wait time. I live walking distance to the restaurant and I called ahead to see if there was a wait for outside seating and they said no. I get there and they tell us it's a 35 min wait. But whatever, it's just 35 min right? No. It ended up being an HOUR AND A HALF wait until we eventually just LEFT!

He also said that everyone there claimed to have a service dog, which is a lie. I know there are a lot of people who have fake therapy/service dogs but I actually have a service dog and by law you are required for the dog to have a service vest on that says ""working"" and ""do not pet"". None of the dogs there were wearing those vests and they were all fighting, and some of them were playing, like it was a fucking circus lollll. He also tried to say he's been a manager at that location for a year when they have only been open for a month!

727,"After reading the Federalist Papers you'll understand better how this great country was created. It was the brilliant thinking and writings of a surprising few that formed the unique U.S Constitution--the foundation for the most powerful, just, and free nation on the planet.The Papers are a series of eighty-five essays written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison and published in various colonial publications during 1787 and 1788, just as the great Constitutional Convention takes place in Philadelphia. They cover a wide variety of topics, each designed to describe the design and justification for the new republican federal government: the House, the Senate, the Presidency, the Judiciary, States' Rights, the Bill of Rights, etc. The essays are difficult to read in today's language. The writing style is verbose and stuffed with big words. Some of the longest sentences ever written are in there. But by plowing through this national treasure, one makes these observations:One, these guys were smart. Hamilton and Madison possessed intellects unsurpassed by anyone in our federal government before or since. They envisioned literally the entire complex structure of the government before it even existed. And two, they did their homework. They applied their great brilliance to the study of political science and the vast wealth of historical experience offered by all the countries of the world. To make their points they often reference the examples of England, France, Spain, and the ancient civilizations of Greece, Rome, and more.After reading the Federalist Papers, one can't help but come away with a renewed sense of patriotism, a sense of awe at the rare beauty of our democracy, and a glowing appreciation for U.S. citizenship. It's amazing to me that these documents aren't more popular. I went all the way through school, and never heard of the Federalist Papers. I don't think they're appropriate in raw form for most school kids (they'd be bored to death), but we ought to at least teach that the Papers exist.

The acting is hideous and i'm not picking on Madonna here, we all know she's useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious. My back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines. The editing is so sloppy, it beggars description. The photography and composition (which in this era, competence should be a GIVEN for any film with a budget) are astonishingly inept, even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking. These are BASIC elements of filmmaking, if you can't get them right, you should seek another line of work. It's as contrived as a grade 3 production of Snow White, except nowhere near as well made or interesting.<br /><br />The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly acted and written, featuring breathtaking visuals - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair.

731,"After having seen Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction don't seem so extreme. Maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy, but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently.<br /><br />When I started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the ""Dueling Banjos"" scene. In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible. As I watched Drew(Ronny Cox,Robocop)go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get. When you think that the kid has a small banjo, which he could of probably made by hand, compared to Drew's nice expensive guitar, you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are.<br /><br />As the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits. But what really distinguishes this film, about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman(Excalibur) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes. So as the movie goes into full horror and suspense I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.<br /><br />The acting is universally excellent. With Jon Voight(Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds(Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading the great cast. Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start, Voight's character transforms over the course of the movie. Ned Beatty(Life) is also good in an extremely hard role, come on getting raped by a hillbilly, while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance.<br /><br />One thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's.<br /><br />Overall Deliverance was excellent and I suggest it to anyone, except for people with weak stomachs and kids. 10/10.

737,"I've never understood this type of spoof movies. You get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart-jokes and such. We've seen it many, many times, and it's never really been funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre, though I honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This movie, as is clearly understood simply from the title, concentrates on making childish fun of Pulp Fiction. That's the main reason I decided to watch it, as I found that film to be overly indulgent of Tarantino's sick mind and powerfully overrated. I had hoped for one or two good jokes, making fun of the overly violent and pointless type of movie that Pulp Fiction was in every aspect, in my (anything but) humble opinion. I was sorely disappointed. The plot is pretty much a rip-off of Tarantino's film, with a few scenes spoofing other, often better, films, in the same childish and humorless fashion. The pacing is poor, and often you'll sit there, being able to guess the outcome of every scene, predicting every joke, often thinking of a better one at the spot, bored out of your mind. The acting is bad. The characters are clich√©s and stereotypes, and are intentionally paper-thin in order to make fun of the characters they're based on... problem is, it doesn't work. It just makes the movie that much harder to sit through. The humor is juvenile and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that they managed to find some actors that looked like the people they were supposed to look like. The film is an awful waste of the actual real actors involved. Possibly slightly entertaining to fans of the typical spoof movies of the same kind. I recommend this only to people who truly loathed Pulp Fiction, or fans of the Zucker parody films. Everyone else: avoid. 1/10",movie
738,"This memoir is much better than I would have expected from the former Sex Pistol. I had been reading his interviews and listening to his music since the late seventies, and he was never one for accurate introspection.I loved the music and the interviews, and I enjoyed this story immensely. Most of it really is a story, though, and while I'm ready to accept that Lydon honestly believes he is remembering things accurately, long-time fans will notice otherwise. For instance, his supposed inspiration for the 'Johnny Rotten' character--a blend of Richard III and Pinky from &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;--seems taken straight from the (very literary) pop weeklies of the time.There are other distortions and evasions. The most galling flaw, however, is his constant tendency to conradict himself. Make up your mind, Johnny; is rudeness a refreshingly spiky assault on British blandness (when practiced by you) or an unforgiveable outrage (when practiced by others)? Were you disconsolate at Punk's failure to unite all social classes, or do you truly feel your oft-expressed contempt for every class but your own? The inconsistencies go on and on....Overall I liked this book, I think the prose truly captured Lydon's character, and the anecdotes he tells are illuminating.

Well, then again, me and my friends had a lot of fun watching it.<br /><br />I doubt there is anything about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. All of the characters are overused movie clich√© cardboard-box roles that don't even require acting skills; accordingly, such skills are not delivered. We have the corrupt cop, a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families whilst caring nothing about people he shoots in the forehead at so close a range as to have blood spat on his face. We have the ""worn-out cop on the edge"" so nicely pointed at in the discussion boards of this movie; we have the old one-day-away-from-retirement-cop who just about everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside, since he had most to gain and he didn't utter a trustworthy word throughout the movie. About as see-through as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster king was a copy of all previous big black gangster kings in movie history (they could've just called him Marcellus Wallace), but just slightly tougher and more ruthless, because something has to emphasize that we also know Laurence Fishburne from actually good movies. Then we finally have the HIGHLY EDUCATED doctor who can't think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from her ordinary life and who spends the majority of the movie sitting in a corner helplessly trying to figure out how to hold on to the weapon she was given. NOT USING IT.<br /><br />The whole siege story is not interesting, not original (having been used twice before), and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting to it. There is the initial probe, then the laying of the siege, then the assault, then the escape attempts. Meanwhile a bunch of strained, stressed, freaked out cops and thugs manage to hold off a Police assault team with high-tech equipment and the quite important advantage of VISION. Then again, in deep night, with the power cut and with a snow storm raging overhead, there is definitely a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about night vision.<br /><br />But the best part comes right at the end. In the first scenes showing Precinct 13, we see it is situated in an outskirt of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. From this point, the besieged walk maybe a hundred meters in a sewer and where do they end up? Some alley ending right in the middle of a forest! A FOREST! Where did that forest come from? Who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it looked deceptively FLAT?? <br /><br />From here I leave the judgment to you, and to your common sense. Go and see this movie if you're looking for an unintended good laugh, I can really recommend it.",movie

I am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old, but that would be mean -- to 7-year-olds.<br /><br />Okay, but what about the subject? I was looking for some insight into the state of the wine industry worldwide, you know, Mondovino. What the film is about is a very narrow view of one intrigue in that world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narration that would put the whole deal into context, so we are left with the selective process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There's no shortage of despicable characters, or even despicable dogs, in sight. There is a shortage of evenhandedness, however. <br /><br />Is the director a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera dipped, swerved, zoomed in a chaotic flourish. Small grower in France: good. Huge grower in USA: very, very bad. Forget about the hundreds of small wineries throughout North America, Australia, and South America. There is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours.<br /><br />To learn about the intrigue more, you are better off reading about it elsewhere.

743,"Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, an impudent, violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother, but each is seperate, and utterly unique. He changes completely, with each character he takes on. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything.

Case in point: We came on Labour Day at 4:30pm to get our hands on their exquisite uni temaki (i.e. sea urchin cone) at 50% off. The lineup wrapped around the food truck and spilled onto the sidewalk, where we then proceeded to wait for 2 hours. 

Now, I normally wouldn't wait this long for food, but 50% off greatness warrants an exception. Moreover, whatever hangriness I had was quickly forgotten as I sunk my teeth into my uni temaki ($8.50, normally $17). A flood of creaminess from the uni coats your tongue as pops of flavour burst from the ikura (i.e. salmon roe) and yuzu tobiko (i.e. flying fish roe). Sweet snow crab, plump scallops, and shredded shiso leaf and gold leaf further enhance the mouthfeel on a blanket of fluffy sushi rice and crisp seaweed. Takenaka serves their temaki open-faced, so you can eat with your eyes first. Thank God my friend convinced me to get 2 uni temakis for myself as I was able to start and end my meal on a high note. 

The uni temaki sold like hotcakes, with our group fortunately being the last to get them despite arriving only 30 minutes after opening. (In hindsight, I think Takenaka should consider limiting promotion items per person as two people in front of us ordered 5-6 each.) What thoroughly impressed me was what followed: one of the staff exited the truck and announced that, in lieu of the uni temaki, Takenaka would provide 50% off any menu item. He then went to each person in line to directly apologize and tell them about the substitute offer. The customer service was simply exceptional. 

In between bites of my uni temakis, I also had a Bara Chirashi ($15): a glorious bowl of sushi rice topped with sashimi and tamago (i.e. egg) cubes, snow crab, scallop, ikura, tobiko, radish sprouts, and shiso marinated kelp. The fun doesn't stop there though as there is a middle layer of shredded tamago and a bottom layer of additional sashimi! While it may not seem like a large portion, it is deceptively filling for the sheer amount packed inside. It reminded me of a smaller version of their Family Size Deluxe Seafood Bowl ($88), which is decadence in a platter with its gorgeous spot prawns and uni (if the latter is still in stock). So fresh, and so good. Honestly, it's a pretty solid deal when you compare it to what you'd get for the same price point at upscale Japanese restaurants. 

Would I order from Takenaka again? While the prices and the lineup may deter me, I still would because the quality is definitely there. The food is not only incredibly fresh, but it is also beautifully presented. If there's a promotion, you can certainly count me in. I've learned my lesson to come before opening though!",restaurant

746,"I've been looking for an affordable book on silversmithing for years. &quot;Silversmithing&quot; is *it* . If I ever buy another book on raising metal, it won't be because there's something lacking in this one; &quot;Silversmithing&quot; covers the topic from spout to handle and to foot to lid.As a writer, I appreciate the effort that went into writing and organizing this work. As a lifelong metalsmith, I've learned techniques from my first skim that are only hinted at in other works on the subject. Feingold and Seitz have managed to do something where other authors in the jewelry field have fallen short: they explain the details that lifelong familiarity tends to omit as obvious or so natural as to be forgotten. Where Herbert Maryon's &quot;Metalwork and Enamaling&quot; and Oppi Untracht's &quot;Jewelry Concepts and Techniques&quot; (both excellent books, by the way) fall short, &quot;Silversmithing&quot; shines in concept, craftsmanship, and finish. And yes, in the details, where the true art of precious metalwork is revealed.Regardless of price, &quot;Silversmithing&quot; is a worthy addition to any serious metalworker's library; at under $40, it's a *must have*.",book
747,"Some things just won't stay dead. They just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not. I guess some people like to beat a dead horse. The first 'Ghoulies' was a surprise hit and it's first sequel was an even better film. The third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little buggers were starting to overstay their welcome. I guess someone out there in Hollywood thought it was a bright idea to resurrect the franchise, but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entries.<br /><br />Pros: The acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this. A silly, but fun score. Moves at an alright pace. Some cheese for those who love it. Some pretty good action-packed sequences. Has a bit more plot than the others and unlike II & III at least attempts to link itself with the original.<br /><br />Cons: Not nearly as much fun as it's predecessors. Though it has more plot than before, it's a pretty ridiculous one. Poor effects. The original Ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here they're replaced with two trolls who serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are lame. Is a direct sequel to the first film, but there are so many loose ends. For example, I thought Jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original? Not that it was spectacular in the others, but this film's direction is especially bland.<br /><br />Final thoughts: The first three 'Ghoulies' movies are a bad movie lovers' dream. This fourth, and so far final sequel (Let's hope), is a bit of a letdown. Sure there's some fun to be had, but it just isn't the same. The others are low budget too, but the people involved put a lot more into them. See if you're a completeist or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits. Otherwise just stick with the other three.<br /><br />My rating: 2/5",movie

Most of the places it was filmed at no longer exist, such as the nightclub, the pizza shop, etc. The ""world premiere"" was held at The Akron Civic Theatre and we all laughed hysterically at how inane it was.

751,"John Ruskin (1819-1900) was an English art critic and social reformer. In this book, Urban Studies professor Michael Lang argues that Ruskin's ""urban vision"" was influential on later movements (such as theGarden Cities of To-morrowof Ebenezer Howard). Lang admits, however, that ""Unfortunately, Ruskin's influence was considerably diluted due to several public scandals that touched his life.... But somehow, he always bounced back from these reversals and continued to work up to his final years.""Lang quotes a description by Ruskin of the Abbeville community in France, and observes, ""This poetic description of Abbeville contains all of the elements of Ruskin's urban vision: good landscape architecture, urban design, idiosyncratic vernacular architecture, limited urban realm, and environmental sensitivity, the use of public folk art, beautiful streetscape and site planning all set in a descriptive framework redolent of a happy folk culture. Few urban and planning design texts have succeeded in putting their message so simply, clearly and tellingly.""Lang writes, ""Many of Ruskin's followers such as William Morris took up what was to become a crusade against the evils of the industrial system."" Nevertheless, Lang argues that ""Ruskin was not an antiurbanist; to the contrary, he appears as a lover of all beautiful cities and their chief defender.""""The extent of (Ruskin's) influence can be gleaned from the fact that Ebenezer Howard used it in his seminal work 'Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform,' the book that launched the Garden City movement in 1898."" He adds, ""The conceptualization of the garden city is usually credited to Ebenezer Howard, but Howard himself clearly acknowledged his debt to Ruskin.""Lang summarizes nine ""principles of Ruskinian belief that have had an impact on architecture, urban design and town planning,"" such as, ""Good art was always vernacular art,"" ""Society must have a respectful, non-exploitative relationship with God given nature and land,"" ""Society should be organized on a clear hierarchical basis,"" ""All beautiful old buildings are a reflection of the society that produced them and they must be preserved, but not 'restored,'"" etc.This book restores a forgotten figure in the ""urban planning"" scene to his rightful place.",book

Whether at Tulane Stadium (the setting for the Super Bowl in the book), at the Orange Bowl (the setting in the movie), or any other of America's crowded sports venues, all it would take is a well-placed bomb or something worse (?!) to turn carefree fun into chaotic frenzy.Black Sunday is a must for the bookshelf!",book
753,"I have never run into a &quot;history&quot; book so filled with errors, misspellings, misstatements, and omissions as &quot;Presidential Blips&quot; by B.S. McReynolds. I am no historian, but do read my fair share of presidential history. I had just begun the book when I saw that Carter had appointed the first black Secretary of State. Wrong -- Secretary of the Army. George Washington took a boat &quot;to work, sailing...from Mount Vernon to Washington, D.C.&quot; Hardly, since the capital was in New York City and Philadelphia during his tenure. John Tyler was 59 when he remarried. No, only 54. There are errors in dates, names, and facts on, I would guess, one of every three pages of the 258 pages. It is hard to decide on a &quot;personal favorite&quot; mistake. There are just so many, and some are so bizarre as to call into question the factual basis of the entire book. &quot;Martin Van Buren was the first U.S. President who was not a signer of the Declaration of Independence.&quot; Well, Washington, Madison, Monroe, JQ Adams, and Andrew Jackson -- in office before Van Buren -- didn't sign it. Alben Barkley, Truman's veep, is referred to as &quot;Albern W. Barkly.&quot; The &quot;olny&quot; (sic) presidents to be left-handed? Oops, George Bush (# 41) isn't listed. Benjamin Harrison's veep of the first term wasn't renominated at the &quot;1832 Republican Convention in Cincinnati...&quot; Sorry, but that was in 1892 and it was in Minneapolis. The book may have some interesting comments, some illuminating stories, and some rarely-discussed events. But a reader can't rely on much when so many inconsistencies, errors, and omissions are rampant throughout the book. McReynolds uses one entire page of text and illustration to ridicule Dan Quayle's spelling problems. People who live in glass houses...........",book

756,"Words are the currency used in all types of human interactions, but in mathematics they have more precise meanings than in most others. However, while this book is valuable as a reference concerning the definitions of the words, the greatest point of interest is in the origins of their mathematical meanings. I have always been interested in word origins, particularly how the meaning is modified over time. Languages are very dynamic entities, as even the passing of a few generations can lead to significant alterations in both structure and vocabulary.For these reasons, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, making it one of the few dictionaries that I have read nearly cover to cover, although not in that order. Many of the mathematical words have unexpected origins, reflecting in many ways how ubiquitous mathematics is in life. Also, since it is largely an abstract discipline, some of the words had to be ""invented"", as there was no real-world analog that adequately describes them.If you have an interest in the linguistic derivation of mathematical words, then this is one book that you should possess. I occasionally open it at random, and I have never been disappointed in the interesting facts uncovered. Reading them also builds an appreciation for how mathematics has evolved over the centuries.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission.",book

760,"I'm a Black man living in a predominantly Black city. That being said, I have some major misgivings about Tyler Perry's work. I realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him, because he's Black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture. But, I honestly do believe that, were Perry White, this film would have had the NAACP, Al Sharpton, and Jessie Jackson all over his ass.<br /><br />I have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil. The characters are poorly written and acted. The jokes are so bad, I have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny. I'm just going to break this big pile of sh-t down.<br /><br />Madea=suck. The character may have had some appeal, but it doesn't anymore. When the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless. She is unnecessary.<br /><br />The situation with the wife beating fianc√© was horsesh-t. If a woman was so scared to death of her husband, why would she try to run away when he's sleeping in bed. Wouldn't it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work. At any rate, the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that I hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didn't.<br /><br />Then there are the two lovebirds. A bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while he's making his rounds. I couldn't believe it. I really couldn't believe when she agreed to go out with him even more. But, what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch. I don't use this term lightly, but that woman only had two modes. Morose victim and psycho momma. No matter which of these two faces she showed, however, there was one constant. The bus driver wasn't going to get any. He even married her without sampling the goods--WTF! <br /><br />Then there's the family reunion scene. Here we've got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos, grinding for the sake of grinding, shirtless, overly musclebound, b-ball, plus the great taste of Maya Angelou. When those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting, was I wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack. All this crap is going on at the reunion, in laughably easy to separate groups, and then they ring a bell. When they do, everyone drops what they're doing and heads on over for a stern talking too, just like a pack of Pavlov's doggies--WTF!! <br /><br />Then you have the final five minutes of the film. In it we see the abusive fianc√© get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress. There is an impromptu wedding where Black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling--WTF!!! The only reason to watch it this far, besides testing your threshold for pain, is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well. Guess what, it doesn't happen. Instead, Perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe, ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness--WTF!! <br /><br />I'm pretty sure that, if given a day , I could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks. Don't even get me started on the rest of Tyler Perry's films. I'm just going to say this. In my opinion, as a Black guy, D.W. Griffith's legacy lives on. The irony is that it is doing so through a Black man who will be praised for doing what Birth of a Nation did, selling us down the river. I only wish Perry's films were dudes so I could kick them in the nuts. Thanks a lot, dude!!

Said brekkie sammich was a total flop. It was underwhelming. The middle of the sandwich was sparse - only one egg? Barely any cheese.

The film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the time in which the country was involved in WWII. This was typical fare for the studios, which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living.<br /><br />The beautiful Eleanor Powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with. Red Skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning, as he pursues the beautiful Ms. Powell on the ship that is bringing them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man. Also Virginia Grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone.<br /><br />There are good musical numbers featuring Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, in which one sees, among others, the amazing Buddy Rich, who has a few solos with Mr. Dorsey and Ms. Powell.

Therefore I would like to recommend this book to those whom are interested in reading books about friendships.",book
780,"I went to the bookstore and picked up a random Grisham novel. Little did I know that this book had nothing to do with the law. It took me a good two hundred pages to figure it out. The biggest surprise was the fact that this book was the best book I read from him. Grisham proves his worth as a storyteller by providing the simplest story of all - a seven-year-old farm boy's autumn.While Grisham's greatest strength is his knack for telling a good story, his law novels often go beyond the usual and norm to present an almost unlikely scenario. This book simply relies on the accounts of a boy whose life is extraordinary by being almost ordinary. And Grisham pulls this off very well.A boy, living with his parents and grandparents, deals with a typical farmer's struggle - picking season. The family deals with debt, Mexican and hillbilly laborers, townspeople, neighbors, secret affairs, and even a murder. Grisham expertly depicts the simple life of the farmer intermingled with the complexities of rural survival. From the murder of a brutish laborer, to the kid's first glimpse of television, the book's range from action to touching.A simple book by a great storyteller, I recommend this book to all.",book
781,"It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and I say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie cannot hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and a too dark, too dull cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a B-movie, hardly worth your money... Vote: 4/10",movie

783,"Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. In many of films, such ""Do The Right Thing,"" most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism once again being the entire issue.<br /><br />What Lee does, however, is once again demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified, but Christians? Hey, it's ""open season"" on them.<br /><br />Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible. They zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it. Hey, folks, here's another Bible reader and look what he''s like! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.<br /><br />He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing? However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness toward white people doesn't help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /><br />Hey, Spike: start ""doing the right thing"" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, ""get over it.""<br /><br />This is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought- provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.",movie
784,"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes is based on the classic book Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs and is a more faithful adaptation to the classic book, the film has some great scenery like the Jungles of South Africa to the Greystoke mansion, the acting is also great. Chirstopher Lambert did a great performance as Tarzan, it was also his first English speaking role. The film has some funny moments, sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic.<br /><br />The film sees a boat crashing in the Jungles of South Africa and some time later they have a son named John, the Apes go into the hut and one of them kills the Father.

785,"SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />I got this dino-documentarie on DVD at Christmas 2004. I had longed to see it and was by no means disappointed. The score is memorable ( my<br /><br />favourites were the ""Sauropod"" theme song and the ""Winters Coming"" song ). The effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. You actually learn something too ; Stegosaurs MAY have been able to pump their plates with blood. Female T-Rexes MIGHT have gone on a killing spree before laying their eggs. I know there's a lot of people who thought this was based too much on speculation, but there will always be questions that we can only guess at. And there is a lot of hard-core, undeniable FACT as well. We KNOW that some dinosaurs travelled in herds, we KNOW that Diplodocus swallowed stones to grind up vegetation in their stomaches. Despite this ""speculation"" the series did extremely well. So well in fact, that it spawned a followup, a prequel and several specials. If you're a dino-fan, then this IS for you.

Well, I didn't get much insight into that issue, but the book was an interesting read anyway. I enjoyed reading about her growing up on US military bases in Japan. There was a huge section on dealing with the overpowering grief from her son's death. Her description of the 2004 campaign when John Edwards ran for vice president, made it sound like there really were no issues in their marriage or family. The final section of the book was devoted to her battle with breast cancer and the people who helped her through it. It was an interesting read and I hope to read her followup book soon.

789,"If you loved Amadeus and Equus then honestly you probably won't like this play.Unlike either Amadeus or Equus the characters are decidedly NOT larger than life, the issues treated are likewise lacking in stature and unlike even his later Private Ear/Public Eye couplet and one of my personal favorites Lettice and Lovage there isn't even fun dialogue presented to pass the time.In other words, it's a non Peter Shaffer Peter Shaffer play but still it is an early effort by a guy who would be called the reincarnation of Shakespeare for the strength of his later works and for that reason it's worth a look. Now when I saw worth a look I mean for people who are interested in Shaffer.Even at this early stage in his career fascinations that would become all too current are on full display: Shaffer's ability to create gripping dialogue, his delight with music and his fascination with young and old men in crisis that would become the leit motif of Equus and to a lessor but still significant degree, Amadeus.Honestly I can't tell you that I actually liked this play but with what Shaffer would go on to do, I couldn't help but be fascinated by it watching as I did in its ambling rumanitions signs of Shaffer's later genius.

791,"I was sixteen years old when I first read this book. As with many, it was required reading. The night before it was due, I decided I would attempt to muster through it. I kept reassuring myself that if I could manage to hit the halfway mark, I'd be okay...boy, was I in for a surprise! When I got half of the book finished, I realized something strange: for the first time in my life, I did not want to stop reading, even if it was to get a drink or eat. Harper Lee had spun a tale that I could relate to, growing up in Geneva, Alabama. I was Scout. Lee had taken this mixed-up world that we lived in and turned it on its ear by showing it to us through the eyes of someone we once knew--ourselves. So much of this novel reminded me of how I was as a child--wide-eyed and innocent, before the world and all of its troubles set in. I have read many of the reviews here and while most are for the novel, the ones against and the reasoning behind them bother me. Many of the allegations are that this book is prejudice. This book is no more prejudice than any other great work of fiction. It is just portraying life as it was back then. If the truth is always right, then why isn't this book? I'm not agreeing with the views, but am also adult enough to know that they did exist and to acknowledge their presence. The other allegation, that children could not feel the emotion Lee writes about is ludicrous. How can one person know what another feels? Children do experience a whole scale of human emotion, just are unable to give it a name. Any emotion can be felt at any age. To make a long story short, BUY THIS BOOK! You will not be sorry. If you've already read it, reread it and pass it on your children. It will be one thing you passed on that they will be grateful for always.",book

793,"Imagine if you were invisible and could come and go as you pleased, with nobody able to see you. Cool, right? Well, not really. H.G. Wells' ""The Invisible Man"" has the sci-fi master exploring what would happen if a person took an invisibility elixir, and discovered too late that invisibility has some definite downsides. It's possibly Wells' funniest novel, but it also has some wonderfully chilling moments.A strange man arrives at a hotel in Iping, wrapped up in goggles, bandages, scarves, and heavy clothes. He spends most of his time hidden away in his room, doing odd scientific experiments, and avoiding contact with other people -- while still keeping everything except his nose hidden. Meanwhile, the local vicar and his wife are robbed by a mysterious thief... who is completely invisible.Well, you can guess what's up with the stranger -- he's an invisible man, and after a blowup with his landlady he reveals his true.... um, lack of appearance to the entire town. After a series of disastrous encounters, the Invisible Man encounters Dr. Kemp, an old friend to whom he reveals how he became invisible, and what he's done since then... as well as his malevolent plans for the future.H.G. Wells isn't really known for being a funny writer, but the first part of ""The Invisible Man"" is actually mildly hilarious. He writes the first third or so of the book in a fairly light, humorous style, and there are some fun scenes speckled through the story, like a homeless man dealing with the Invisible Man (""Not a bit of you visible--except-- You 'aven't been eatin' bread and cheese?"").But things get much darker after Mr. Kemp enters the scene, and we find out that the Invisible Man is... well, kind of malevolent and crazy. Very crazy.And as the plot grows darker and grimmer, Wells also inserts a clever (if far-fetched even by Victorian standards) explanation for how a person could become invisible, using a mix of science and fantasy. The plot hurtles through wild chase scenes and the occasional riot, and some moments of bleak tension (""When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room, Kemp was still pacing..."")The Invisible Man himself (aka Griffin) is a pretty mysterious character for most of the story, since all we know about him is that he's invisible.... and also kind of a jerk. I mean, the guy constantly flies off the handle and even robs a nice little old vicar. And the more we find out about him, the more malignant and insane he turns out to be.Even if you had a way to become invisible, ""The Invisible Man"" would be a pretty effective way of dissuading people from using it. A deserving classic.",book

796,"THIS POST MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS :<br /><br />Although it was 5 years after the series ended and WB was currently working on Justice League, this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library. Why? Well, if Mask of the Phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of Batman: The Animated Series and SubZero compliments the 15 episodes of the Adventures of Batman and Robin, then Mystery of the Batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the Gotham Knights version of Batman. Kevin Conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection. I admit I was a bit leery when I heard about Batwoman and all I could think about were the old 50's comics of Batman. But I was blown away by the Batwoman character, her look, her costume (which I assumed inspired Bruce Wayne to create the costume on Batman Beyond)and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who Batwoman is all the way through. If you want to know who Batwoman is, then buy or rent the DVD. Barbara Gordon makes a cameo appearance and I think the writers were trying to hint that Bruce and Barbara had something going on between them like they did in Batman Beyond. Tim Drake appears as Robin, but his role is a small one and sadly, there is no sign of or mention of Dick Grayson alias Nightwing, which leads me to believe he has established himself in Bludhaven (his city in the comics).<br /><br />Of the three suspects for Batwoman, my favorite is Kathy Duquesne, who looks an awful lot like Halle Berry. Kelly Ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects. When it comes to the villains, I'm glad the Penguin was one of them, but I did not like the fact that they replaced Paul Williams with David Ogden Stiers. Pengy just didn't sound right. Same thing goes for Robin. The new guy did okay, but just as I was starting to get used to Matt Valencia, they replaced him. It's interesting to note that Kevin Michael Richardson, who voices Carlton Duquesne is now the voice of the Joker in ""The Batman"" series. And we finally see what Rupert Thorne looks like revamped since he didn't show up in the Gotham Knights episodes. The late John Vernon will be missed. Although I enjoyed Henry Silva as the voice of Bane, if he had to be replaced, they got the right man in the form of Hector Elizondo. I only wish they could have used Two Face, Riddler, or the scary new version of the Scarecrow.<br /><br />The musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb. I wish that was on a soundtrack and I especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented Cherie in the Iceberg Lounge along with her song, Betcha Neva. While some feel that this movie is weaker than the Mask of the Phantasm and Subzero, I find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest, plus like I said earlier, it's a full length movie based off the Gotham Knights version of Batman, which I think gives a good balance. I would at least recommend renting this DVD first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie, but personally, it's well worth the purchase. I give Mystery of the Batwoman a 9.",movie

The commentaries do not represent the conscious thoughts of the artist, but instead try to achieve a subsequent understanding of the paintings and thus hint at possible interpretations.

814,"Out of Zhivago's loves I always liked Marina the best and, when the movie came out, I was puzzled to see that David Lean and Robert Bolt had left her out, excised her completely. It made me wonder why, why leave out the enchanting figure of Marina, the only one in Zhivago's world who was as faithful to him as a dog is to his master, one who was there at the beginningMaybe they thought that audiences were already being asked to swallow too much. Yurii Andreievich had married Tonia already, and had Sasha with her, and then the good doctor had found himself madly in love with Lara. That tragic romance ended badly and then Yuri finds himself completely without friends or family and he stumbles, like a bum, back into the life of Marina. I guess the filmmakers thought that they were painting Lara and Uri to have the greatest love of all time, so where did Marina fit in? Anyone who's read the book knows that Marina's love for Yuri was stronger by far than the crazy, tender, adulterous love of Lara. Zhivago is such a good poet that Tonia, Lara and Marina are all aquiver when he draws near them.Marina is more mature (when she re-encounters Yuri) and it's hard to imaghine what actress of the mid-60s would have best been able to essay her character--had Lean and Bolt been more faithful to the novel and included the Marina-Yuri story in it. She is a woman whom time has touched, but lightly, and she has seen the ravages of the Revolution first-hand, while still remaining touched and open to the possibilities of new love. If they could have gotten her, Audrey Hepburn would have been a good choice, sort of the Audrey Hepburn of ROBIN AND MARIAN and TWO FOR THE ROAD. Another performance that comes to mind is Claudia Cardinale in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST--women who have lived and suffered and whose spirit still flames and seeks the higher ground. But perhaps Hepburn and Cardinale were too beautiful (or glamorous) and Pasternak wanted us to find the beauty in a plainer woman.The book is a very different experience than the movie; structured as a poem, the novel moves laterally from time period to time period, while individual associations link disparate stories. We remember that Pasternak was writing about characters of another generation than his own, and that he had already seen the death of Stalin and the public demolition of the dictator's relationship, when he published his novel at last. As a boy he had dreamed of becoming a musician, and it is said that he aped Scriabin in his earliest works. Certainly some of Scriabin's theories of synaesthesia carry over into the marvelously sensual passages of ZHIVAGO, where everything--smells, tastes, the pressures of flesh and flesh--all blend into image.",book

He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujari's posters. But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Dev's mind to be made into a film.<br /><br />This was Dev Anand's perhaps best directorial effort. The film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Dev's sister made a tremendous impact.<br /><br />This film was Dev Anand's call to the nation to keep up their moral values.<br /><br />It is about a Montereal based Indian family and the brother's role is a very affectionate one for his sister. But the parents quarrel and separate leaving Prashant(Dev) with mother and Jasbir(Zeenat) with father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see Prashant again.<br /><br />She is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home. Dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies.<br /><br />To reunite with his sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti(Mumtaz) who was to later marry him and also Janice who in reality is Jasbir with a new name and new identity. She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too.<br /><br />Dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and the people are after his life.<br /><br />This was a story well directed and acted-both by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman but Burman Da did not want Dev to do the film. He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari, though was good, but had been opposed in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people's anger against Dev. But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was indeed a success.<br /><br />R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number.<br /><br />Overall it is a good film.",movie

This book addresses the stepmom as an individual with an obvious need to keep from becoming lost in ""step land"" - which we all too often do! It's a feel good book that encourages and inspires the stepmom from the heart and soul. It helps the stepmom to get down to the brass tacks of stepmotherhood and encourages her to keep life simple with practical and realistic advice.",book

819,"""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is a predictable, 'been there before' thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try. I can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago.<br /><br />The complete lack of originality from the Ronald Bass screenplay (based upon the Nancy Price novel) does not help, nor does the stale direction of Joseph Ruben or the very average performance from Julia Roberts. The supporting cast including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson do little to help.<br /><br />There really isn't a lot to say. Just give it a miss.<br /><br />Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne",movie
820,"When I go to see a movie about zombie's, I'm not expecting oscar calibre performances, or writing on the level of The Godfather, but I do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards, and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera. This movie was just awful, I actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched Cold Creek Manor, that wasn't very good either, but it seemed like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of crap. On the plus side, the girls were very pretty, that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left after the hottest one got killed, there wasn't anything to hold my interest after that.",movie

I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield nor of war-dramas, but I was truly wondering just how and when Winfield would find his child. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. Truth be told, I have not seen this movie in years nor has it been shown on TV in a while, but this movie is somewhat of one man's odyssey after the pains of war. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories. There is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality that he does confront. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.",movie

826,"It was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar had to be made and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally Hollywood spice of Titanic-type love between the lead heroine and the Burmese male lead who happens to be an old man. Thankfully, nothing of that sort was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful.<br /><br />Anyway, the film was honest-to-God and I was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed. Apart from the fact that filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia & Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese locales, I could not find much fault in the film.<br /><br />You cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. It is after all, real events of a civil war. The music by Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it.<br /><br />I was only a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie was made on my real-life experience which I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and needless to say, I could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening wonder for me.",movie

829,"Firstly, this is a very dated film, non-focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual ( which in itself is quite nonsensical, since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual) it reduces me to despair; as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality - it is simply ridiculous. Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree. But no doubt this non-educational message ties in with Godard's use of rock music; hence The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />The song 'Sympathy for the Devil', whose creation we witness, and from which the film takes its name, is in fact nothing special. The chord sequence, which is not especially original, was used to much better effect in Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou'(Led Zeppelin II). Apart form that, 'Sir' Mick Jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner (rather like Bob Dylan)- notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse.<br /><br />Besides the fact that the Black Panthers depicted in this film, don't seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that in fact undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today ( indeed, a message that would belie the behaviour of The Rolling Stones around the time the film was made).<br /><br />No wonder, the DVD came free with The Sunday Times! For a truly profound historical exposition of left-wing sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.",movie

836,"For any fan of Nickelodeon who used to watch the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good on. You had entertaining acts like You Can't Do That on Television. You had weird but good shows like Pete & Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morals like Doug. But just like Disney, Nickelodeon has fallen down the tubes, limiting their demographic to shallow preteens and giving us poor excuses to come up with new, innovative shows. As I tried watching Zoey 101, I just shook my head in disgust.<br /><br />The setting couldn't of been more fake than this one. Each character attends a boarding school called Pacific Coast Academy, boasting everything that a spoiled child wants. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in every room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. The kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers. It looks more like a place that you would spend on a nice summer vacation rather than to work and study while preparing for college.<br /><br />The characters were also a factor that turned me off. Every episode consists of boy problems, situations that they caused themselves, and troubles that should be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) seems perfect in anything she does, and each of her friends ask her for help when they feel they are in grave danger. Only leading her to have no other side. I've been through school and I can tell you, nobody is like that. Chase is dumb. Logan plays the arrogant tough guy. Quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic in what she does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is just well, a tough person. Why not use some originality? Something that is unique for these characters, and different from other personalities? Is being stereotypical the best the creators of this show can come up with? Instead, these actors are dull personalities with the sense in that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles. There is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at.<br /><br />Not only that, but the show is clearly for the intent of aiming for kids of adolescence, facing a stage in that they must evolve from being a child to being an adult. Through that period they must learn to study on their own, make their own decisions, and do what's right for them. Zoey 101 contains nothing of those values. In this case, we are supposed to believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed. I'm sorry, but that simply isn't true. People can't expect things to be handed to them like the actors in this show are and just let those things sit there. If I expect things in Zoey 101 to happen in real life, then I would be living in a fantasy world locked away in a dream house. Nothing in this show relates to those who face health and money issues. Neither does it relate to kids wanting to learn something meaningful.<br /><br />So in conclusion, Zoey 101 is a show made by Nickelodeon that only falls flat on it's face. It displays a horrible message for kids and I highly think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Sure, it doesn't have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid. A horrible show, and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage Nickelodeon has been making in recent years.<br /><br />1 out of 10.",movie

839,"I was in a search for a different book when I saw this one in my favorite bookstore. I wasn't going to pick it up ~~ but when I started reading the first paragraph, I couldn't put it down. Weldon's writing is gripping, brutally honest and so true ~~ and it hit home so close to the dark secrets in your heart.I wasn't in an abusive relationship/marriage for very long but reading this book helps reaffirm my decision to leave my husband ~~ she writes of how bad things were before she finally decided to leave. I left before it got worse and before there were innocent children involved. And after reading this book, I am glad that I left as soon as I did.It is encouraging to read about one woman's trials, fears as it helped me realize that I am not the only one. I too came from a loving stable family ~~ my relationship with my dad mirrors Weldon's. We both love our fathers deeply and they are good men. We both searched for men like our fathers and in the process, got hurt. Weldon's reasons for staying in the marriage mirrors mine. We didn't stay because of low self-esteem, but because we believed in our husbands and encouraged them to be the men we thought we knew they could be. We stayed till there were no reasons left to stay. We can still say to this day that we did everything we could to make our marriages work. We are not failures even though we may feel like that.As for me, seeing the struggles she had with her three sons hit home. I wanted to have children, but something deep inside me told me to wait. I am so glad that I listened to this inner voice because I cannot imagine how much harder it would be for me to leave if I had children with my husband. Reading about Weldon's struggles reaffirmed my decisions to wait. I find myself saying about her husband ~~ what a jerk!If you or anyone you know is in an abusive relationship, I urge you to pick up this book. Though in the midsts of struggles, where you feel the deepest and darkest despairs and fears, there is a glimmer of hope that life will get better. It does ~~ even if it means changing your whole life to escape from the batterer. But once you're outside and &quot;free&quot; you will begin to heal though the scars will always be there. Picking up this book is such a uplifter for me ~~ knowing that I am not the only one who struggled with domestic violence. I also know that I am not alone in my fears and despair. I, who is a professional worker and from a good family, am not the failure. He is. He can change himself but I can't. When I left him, I did feel a sense of relief. There's no more worrying and fears of what he might do next. It's a hard long road leaving someone you love, but when one comes to the realization that he will never change, there's a freedom in knowing that you still have your life left. And thanks to Weldon, I now know that I am not alone in this struggle.",book

We also ordered a Cornish pasty (it was NOT needed because the portions are large).  I tried just a bite because I was so full, but my husband ate the rest of it.

Ok, moving on, Demon Spirit attacks...""]<br /><br />Example two: At one point the priests need an answer to a question, and only a demon (or something, who cared by now) could provide it. How? Why, you have to ask a dying man! So the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing, gasping man. ""Hey, don't kill him!"" or maybe ""That's not nice!"" would have been more realistic then their response.

Really graphic violence and torture. Be warned the book will make you ill.,book

I didn't hear airplanes from the nearby airport. That's great.
The front desk employee was efficient and professional. Maybe not so personable but he was efficient.
The Hotel seems secure because you have to use a keycard to access floors on the elevator.
There is a restaurant Burger Theory at the hotel, which I did not dine at.
Parking is $12/Day but I did not park there. I used the hotel shuttle.
The hotel shuttle from and to the airport was timely and I met a younger male driver who drove me to the hotel from the airport and he was super friendly. We talked about current events and my recent trip on the short drive and he speaks English and Spanish.

875,"This is one of the best movies to come from Bollywood in years. Certainly the best this year until now. Indian to the core, the panoramic visuals, the heart-pleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one. The apt depiction of Indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for his/her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life.<br /><br />This movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses. If you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through on-screen action, sex or terror, then this movie is not for you, because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it. It is as simple a story for a movie as it can get. But that's exactly where the art of the movie lies. One gets a real life experience, and the best thing is, this experience is one full of values and hope. It is about the positive side of life, about the sweet things that God has showered on humans, as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons, terrorists and underworlds. This is not about things and people that have gone bad. It is about the goodness that still persists, and that keeps the world running. Of course, every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths. <br /><br />Having said that, here's more... <br /><br />The movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage - yes, that's right, it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents, and learn to love each other. The 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time, not full of ""enticing"" happenings, but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other. They learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives, and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage. But have these been strengthened enough? Their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune. Will they pass this test? That is what ""Vivah"" is about.",movie
876,"I used to love coming here because it wasnt too far of a walk and the staff was so great! During 'rona times though, super awkward. I am glad they are open and have a reservation system working, but the entire dining experience left a lot to be desired. They gave us two menus to write down and mark what we wanted. Thats fine, but it clearly says on the menu, one per table. It seems wasteful. Also, i wonder what they are doing with the pencils they are handing out and if those are then thrown away or washed? Why not just keep with normal menus? 
The waitress was great though you dont really interact. When youre done making selections on items, place it on a side table next to the table you're sitting at. Again, not sure the purpose of it other than waste and 'social distancing'

I asked for salt and pepper and the person who brought it was wearing gloves. Cool, I hope they were clean and changed and I hope the salt shakers were either wiped down or autoclaved? Can you do that? Either way I let it go as it wasnt worth a fuss. 

They still bring the checks out on the little clipboard but expect you to use a website to pay instead of what they were doing. I thought the point was to stop people from touching all the things, but here we are touching some compressed porus particle board. Meh, if thats what they want. I loved that I can use apple pay to pay and just be done. The experience left a lot to be desired, but we were happy to be out of the house.

Brioso limits the number of customers in the store, uses stickers to promote distancing and someone takes your order to accept payment from a distance. Ask to add gratuity so it can be adjusted if you don't have cash to tip. After you order and pay, you'll step through the hallway to the other side of the shop for order pickup.

878,"After spotting the high rating on IMDb, I decided to go see this movie. Beyond that high rating, I intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations.<br /><br />Given my rating, you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary stuff.<br /><br />First chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts in a believable manner. He's freaked out. I'm encouraged and think to myself, this is going to be good. The people who made this movie understand that less is more.<br /><br />But it's what happens next that was a big let down. The subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach... Just blast the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works. Let's see, a clock radio that turns on by itself? Good, that's always scary. Objects that move around in the room? Good, you can't complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sink? Great. Ghosts that commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises, shaking, fire, more shaking, messing up the room, more blood, etc etc. It's all good. And it's all been done before. Overstimulate our Attention Deficit Disordered audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession, and they won't be able to look away.<br /><br />Well, it didn't work for me. And you know what else? When I go see a horror movie in a theater, it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments. But this movie had no scary moments. The audience was silent and disinterested. I felt no chill down my spine. Nothing. The Shining was 100x what this movie tries to be.<br /><br />So who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry, I just don't get it.",movie

883,"Greetings again from the darkness. Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work... no matter the conditions, else his reason for living ceases. To see Goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. It is his lifeforce. When you see his failures, energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon. It is not the dread of beginning again, it is that he takes his energy from his work. Watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful, but nonetheless, breathtaking. He discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same. When he says he needs the earth, but it does not need him ... I beg to differ. Only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best.",movie

887,"Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no business being the lead except in a low budget movie. He really does not have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has a lot more screen presence, and sadly he is not really the main character. Most of the screen time goes to the brick-faced Rooker.<br /><br />Danielle Harris (from the Halloween 4 and 5 movies) plays his daughter, and she is cute and entertaining but she is written as not being too smart and one of her dumb mistakes gets one of the main characters killed. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait, and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just watching what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /><br />Vincent Schiavelli plays the Consigliare to the local Mafia Godfather, and it is hard to tell whether or not he is working the movie as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. He seems to be in every extremely low budget direct-to-video action movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film made it feel like a spoof. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? It is hard to tell at some points. There is certainly very little Yakuza action. <br /><br />The supporting cast of Thugs and Goons is menacing and well cast. Some of these kinds of movies have Thugs that look like they work at the local Comic Book Store or as stock boys at Piggly-Wiggly. Overall this movie is very uneven. At some points it seems like a comedy or a parody. Then at other points it works as a good action movie. Then it sputters to an end. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi this movie would rate a Zero in my humble opinion.",movie

890,"I delved into this book with great anticipation. The author is only a few years younger than my mother and the area she writes about in rural Iowa is just 50 miles east of where my grandfather was born. It brought back a lot of memories for me as I am sure it will for many other readers.There were many things to like in this book that combines anecdotes from the 1930s with recipes and how to do things the old way. I enjoyed the anecdotes and would have enjoyed the book if it had been sprinkled with less of the recipes and more of the stories from the 1930s--stories which ranged from poignant to laugh-out-loud funny. Her stories range from such events as box socials (and giving a complete explanation of what one is for those who may not know) to how to gather honey from bees (and what happens if you do it the wrong way). She tells of how hard work it was it was back in the day, but does recall there was time for a bit of leisure as well.At once a memoir, a how-to book, and a cookbook, Kalish tells her story with enthusiasm but with a bit of pompousness that was a bit unnecessary. She acts as if she was the only person ever to know how to do some of these things described and that her way was the only way. Heck, I am 25 years younger than she is and I can remember doing many of the same things at my grandparents' farm in North Dakota two decades later, and even do some of these same things today. Although the subtitle mentions ""hard times"" it is clear that due to help from her grandparents and a self-sufficient farm, Kalish and her siblings never really went without anything on her farm during the depression so anyone who is reading this book and expects it to be a true hardship tale best look elsewhere. It is a great look down memory lane for those from Kalish's generation who I am sure will enjoy reading and reminiscing about another time and place. It seems though that most of the time the author is writing for an audience who hasn't lived through any of these events, remembers none of these times (stoking an old wood fire, splitting wood,making head cheese, butchering a chicken, making May Day baskets). That said, it is quick interesting read but recommended with reservations as although a memoir, how-to book and cookbook, it doesn't completely succeed at any of these.",book

895,"Fortunately, I did not have to read this book in grade school, because I would not have gotten anything out of it at the time. For those interested in character-driven stories and with the patience for 19th-century prose, however, Silas Marner is worth reading.This short book tells the story of a man who more or less withdraws from life after a crushing betrayal, to be eventually reawakened through his love for a child. It's a sweet story, at times saccharine and with some all-too-convenient plot elements, but still, it's a good one. The writing, of course, is excellent, sometimes sarcastic, and peppered with incisive observations about human nature. For the most part, the characterization is excellent; I fully believed in the Raveloe villagers, and even the minor ones are distinct and realistic.But then there is Eppie, the original Pollyanna--so perfect she's more plot device than person. Even when she misbehaves, she does so adorably; as a toddler she never throws tantrums, and as a teenager she's never for a moment rebellious or selfish or withdrawn. She's a fantasy child, with none of the human foibles the other characters display, and it's because of her that the later part of the novel sometimes becomes saccharine.Overall, though, a sweet, enjoyable story from a gifted writer. I decided to try this one before Middlemarch, and it's good enough that I'm eager to try Eliot's major work.",book

898,"If the directors/producers/publicists wish to promote a film as ""based on actual events"" and make a film that is meant to inspire and have meaning then, for a start, to maintain any sort of creditability and integrity, you would want to keep a film as honest as you possibly can.<br /><br />A team wearing ""all black"" jumpers and doing the haka in America is just plain dumb. Any half intelligent person would know that the ""All Blacks"" are the National Rugby Union team of New Zealand and their jumpers are all black and the Haka is performed by them as a part of a traditional Maori dance.<br /><br />Having such stupidity in a movie, without explanation, merely reduces the credibility of the movie to zero and negates the message and inspiration that the movie is trying to achieve.<br /><br />The question is ""Why""? Why would you do such a stupid thing and for what possible gain?<br /><br />I can only conclude that the writers or director or producers have seen it on TV before a international Rugby union match and thought ""wow, that would be great in our movie, no one will know that it never happened, they're all too dumb to know about NZ nd the all blacks, this will be great.""<br /><br />How would an Americian audience react to a movie made in NZ about Americain grid iron, with a team wearing an American Indian costumes and war paint, doing a native American Indian war dance, running round in circles shouting ""oh woo woo woo, oh woo woo woo"" react?

The film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any sense.<br /><br />The film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings I have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air.

Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others, the half-life of a vampire.<br /><br />It's a sad movie, but not sappy.

901,"In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical. I sure can't do better than that. It's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either.<br /><br />Louis B. Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it, Cover Girl became a classic. So if Mayer didn't learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance.<br /><br />The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney wasn't lending Mickey out to nobody. Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film. Not to worry because MGM had it's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry.<br /><br />Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire. For the next dozen years, these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff. It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit. In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity.<br /><br />When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own. He'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Fall in Love Too Easily. Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl. It's Sinatra at his best. <br /><br />With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person. They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career.<br /><br />On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings. She also did some classical numbers.<br /><br />Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot. Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. Trying to fix her up with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi. They spend the film trying to accomplish just that. <br /><br />My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn' never got a number herself. She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood. I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM's vaults it might still be.<br /><br />Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more. All that creative talent was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. If you had to pay market value for it, the cost might retire some third world country's debt.<br /><br />But the film results would be extraordinary.",movie
902,"This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.<br /><br />Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone on to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage.<br /><br />Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. I mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But he did it well, anyway.<br /><br />Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling.<br /><br />I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theater. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she shouldn't have), though he tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought even then, after his first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, or at least a major, highly-respected actor.<br /><br />Despite the garbagey aspects of the garbagey script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, his name is now usually listed at or near the top.<br /><br />Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond.<br /><br />Just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral or immoral. Terrible movie. Terrible movie idea.<br /><br />Added comment: Too many people answer ""Was this comment helpful?"" with a ""no"" because they disagree with the expressed opinion.

906,"To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan on one of the many DVD commentaries, that ""wobbly music"" over the HTV logo was enough to get me jumping from whatever I was doing to glue my face against the screen for an hour. The individual stories contained within the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful. Robin of Loxley goes through a very convincing journey over the two series he appears in, even though his departure from the programme was unplanned. Marian also develops her relationship with both of Herne's sons very well.<br /><br />After languishing for many years in TV wasteland, I re-encountered the series on Sky 1 in the UK in the mid nineties and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than I remembered. This is no children's television programme, it deals with witchcraft, treason, rebellion and injustice. And, it manages to do it without showing too much blood. As far as I can recall, you only see a bit of the red stuff in the Pilot film (Episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD set). The DVDs are great, containing a wealth of extras including cast commentaries on Series 3 only (the Jason Connery Robin) and crew commentaries for Series 1 and 2. The picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing.<br /><br />The idea of freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing's forgotten.

907,"I have been reading all of the reviews and I assume the greatest majority of those who have written these reviews must either be liberals, atheiests or members of the ACLU. I worked in a school district for 20 years and I know that there is bias when it comes to Christmas and Christianity. I know that mennorrahs are allowed in schools, but Christian symbols are not. I know that a Jewish calendar of events and holidays can be posted but Christian ones cannot. And I am simply wondering how the ACLU and it's adherents can proclaim freedom of speech for everyone from atheiests to pornographers to Muslims to Jews to gangsta rap and explicit sexual themes, but do not allow the same rights for Christians. Guess what? I am not an Evangelistic or fundamentalist Christian. I believe in the individual right to religious freedom, but I can't stand the hypocracy of the ACLU, liberals, and atheiests who proclaim freedom of speech to everyone but Christians. The liberals preach if you don't like what you see on television or in magazines then don't watch it. Shouldn't the same be said about Christians who want to display their symbols of Christianity. If I can look at a mennorrah or a cresent and star why am I not allowed to look at a cross. Shouldn't the rights of believers have the same rights as non-believers? And I agree with John Gibson when he stated that if Christians have to label a Christmas tree as a friendship tree, then why shouldn't the Jewish people have to call the mennorrah a holiday candalabra? Please all liberals, atheiests, and ACLU members, try to use your agendas of freedom of speech for everyone INCLUDING Christians. If not, you are nothing but a bunch of hypocrites.",book

He is obviously an intelligent man, with great knowledge about films and passion for making them, but does this makes him a good director. Definitely NO! A complete anti-talent. He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits, but a film with actors ¬ñ never!<br /><br />He can't direct nor write. His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations/dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word ""art"" in any sense. No way. Not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like. To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.<br /><br />Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store. WHO IS HE KIDDING?<br /><br />He is a cheater; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising. Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction.<br /><br />Just look at Julio Medem.

916,"Not to be confused with the 1943 George Zucco movie ""The Mad Ghoul,"" ""The Mad Monster"" is a film that Zucco appeared in the year before. In this fairly paint-by-numbers affair, Zucco perfects a way to turn his dim-witted handyman, Petro, into a wolf/man hybrid by means of wolf's blood injections, and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments. It is a very simple plot, really, and an extremely low-budget production. Glenn Strange, who plays the man/wolf here, would soon achieve greater fame playing the Franky monster in films such as ""House of Frankenstein"" (1944) and ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948). The makeup job on him here is pretty lame, and only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth (like the one in 1957's ""Teenage Monster""). The sets in this film, in addition, are fairly nonexistent, and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing. I have given the movie a very generous 4 stars, in part because I have an abiding love for 1940s horror films, but truth to tell, most objective viewers would probably deem it laughable crap, and I suppose it is. It's certainly no well-crafted Universal affair or Val Lewton masterpiece, that's for sure! Still, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in undemanding piffle such as this. If you can spare 72 minutes of your life, I suppose you could do worse than ""The Mad Monster"" (not TOO much worse, of course!). Oh...one other thing.

919,"Following the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and playing off the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy, the prequel Cube Zero.<br /><br />Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution, time and place unknown, two low-ranking operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers, some of which are rigged with death traps. Told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection, these observers have had no problem with their jobs until Wynn, a mathematical genius, discovers that one of the prisoners, a woman named Cassandra (Stephanie Moore) never agreed to be put inside the Cube. Suddenly it's realized that perhaps their ""jobs"" are not what they seem, and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted...<br /><br />For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube, this prequel will probably not be to your liking. It's not that the story does not have potential; it's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on. Standing alone, it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message. It was also nicely self-contained. The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original, attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing.<br /><br />What this new film has to offer, which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, certainly are good questions to be raised, but probably should have been done so on their own merits, rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations.<br /><br />Having said this, the other traits of the film, such as acting and direction and writing, are not awful. There is a bleak, dark look to the film akin to such film noir as 'The Matrix' and 'Dark City', and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube. Unfortunately for Barbarash, these are not enough positive qualities to save it.",movie

It's sweepingly long, no doubt, but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more. (I have the series on DVD and I probably watch the series three times a year).<br /><br />Truly, this is an impeccable bit of film-making. Other than Olivier, the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories; whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper.<br /><br />I'm going to go watch it right now (again, my... 11th time).",movie

We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.<br /><br />The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening. I also thought Richmond-Peck's Harvey was also a nice rock in the pond. (This is a good thing).<br /><br />This movie told the age old story of Hollywood folks, going through the ups and downs of stardom. It kept me glued to my TV, and I learned to love Robin, well hell, mostly everybody seem to be the super people I sometimes think Hollywood is. Go figure.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots. We never saw the head of ABC. Just heard him, like Charlie from Charlie Angels (I wonder if this way planed?). It seems so sad, that a show at number 1, could be so destroy by their own network.<br /><br />I think this story could be told about anyone's life, as they climb the ladder of any job.

927,"For people like me who were born long after the '60s ended, we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts, of which ""Hair"" is one. This is certainly a well done tour de force. One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - for me at least - is when the group crashes the rich people's party. As for the movie's final scene, one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the '60s represented.<br /><br />But no matter how one interprets this movie, it's important to understand that even though the '60s themselves may have ended, the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves. It's a time that people won't soon forget.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is one that I definitely recommend.

We all know that animals have emotions, and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature, correct?<br /><br />What we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are ""human"". The filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour, and when it happens they say, ""That monkey is almost human!"" (that's actually a direct quote).<br /><br />Everything is in human terms. They waste time theorizing about what makes dogs ""smile"", but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat.<br /><br />I had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms. I wanted to learn how animals emote in their OWN languages. But instead, researchers keep falling back on pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps ""celebrating Christmas"", and this was enough to turn my stomach.<br /><br />But it doesn't end there. Half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars, and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages. One particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning (though you have to be quick to notice it) where a captive monkey says in sign language, ""Want out. Hurry go.""<br /><br />Obscure references are made to ""stress tests"" and psychological experiments which I shudder to imagine. Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a ""mother figure"". And after 40 years of experiments, the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions.<br /><br />One chimp named ""Washoe"" has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose, and to this day she remains thus.

Not one boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors, a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, crisp black and white photography, a fitting soundtrack, an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works. It's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest, the mark everyone should endeavor to reach.<br /><br />Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing this actress couldn't do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments. It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting.<br /><br />The title fits this movie very well. It is about desires, human desires I think everyone can understand. Actually, no one seems to be scheming in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else. The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go here.<br /><br />I liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the necessity to compromise. The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America. The story has a certain similarity with Fritz Lang's considerably harsher movie Clash by Night, made one year earlier, where Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can also recommend it.",movie

Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting.

951,"With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $3.00, i had to buy it. I enjoyed some moments, like Hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids, but i only really watched to see Matthias Hues' scenes. I particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end. It was a cross between Clint Eastwood's ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"" (a 3 man quick-draw showdown, with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer). Apart from that, there's really nothing more I can add. The actors gave good performances, (all except the ""Assassin Droid"" whose performance was nothing outside of comical) but the movie really lacked depth and purpose; simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time, so we're stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so, until the ball gets rolling. For example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, taking up two-fifths of the movie.<br /><br />The scenery really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the films budget. I don't think we ever did get to see this ""perfect city"" of New Angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached New Angeles, its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of ""kingdom"" the owner/creator of an entire city would dwell in. The ""super-high security"" of New Angeles was also always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to Matthias' approximation of ""at least a hundred men out there"".<br /><br />If you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses in this film, then you may want to watch it, simply to ""add it to the list"". However, if you value 1 and a half hour of your time, or $3.00 of your money, you may want to give this one a miss.",movie

954,"In 1601, Rabbi Judah Loew fashioned a golem from river mud and breathed life into the giant figure to save his Prague community from the Jew-hating townspeople and the whims of a half-mad emperor. From this legend Sherwood builds a magical, earthy tale of passion, the loneliness of difference and the timeless, fruitless search for earthly immortality.The novel opens with the wedding of the orphan seamstress Rochel to the older shoemaker Zev. Though grateful, she finds him physically repugnant. Then one day she meets the eyes of a handsome giant. Beyond the physical attraction, they recognize a kinship of otherness - the golem without a tongue and the daughter of a Cossack rape - and a passion for the details of life, like the play of light on a leaf, the song of a bird, a rainbow in a mud puddle.Meanwhile, the petulant Emperor Rudolph II, wallowing in luxury and self-importance, surrounded by scientists like Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, botches a suicide attempt and decides he must live forever. To this end he summons alchemists and magicians and the rabbi who created life from mud. Knowing they will die when their impossible task is complete, the alchemists put on a splendid, desperate show. Rabbi Loew, facing the massacre of his community, approaches his task more somberly, but with equal ingenuity.As tensions build between Christians and Jews, Catholics and reformers, the emperor sinks deeper into madness, and Rochel and the golem struggle against their passion. With the plot driven by petty, grasping minds, ugly rages and great passions - as well as a few serious ideas, good souls and quick thinkers - the novel mingles comedy and pathos, set in a muddy, stinking, pestilential city brightened by the beauty of art, nature and human joy.Sherwood's (""Green,"" ""Vindication,"" a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award) irreverent, muscular prose is up to the task; witness the emperor's birth:""His mother refused myrrh and valerian root, Turkish poppy, did not even take a drink of water, but bore her pain, which she thought her Christian obligation, although no woman was ever sainted for giving birth, save Mary.""",book

Night Listener is without doubt one of the dullest films I have ever seen.<br /><br />There was nothing happening in this film what so ever - I didn't care for any of the characters, didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot, didn't care how it ended....nothing.<br /><br />There is no comedy, no action, no thrills, no suspense, nothing. The highlights include (no spoilers - there's nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it's horn.<br /><br />I really enjoyed ""One Hour Photo"" and hoped for a similar eerie role from Williams, but alas was sorely let down. What's more disappointing is that I'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just didn't work for me.<br /><br />I might even have given it 1/10 but that score is reserved for the remake of The Producers",movie

957,"There's never any question, when reading one of Garry Wills' books, that the reader is promised a terrific ride.""What Jesus Meant"" is less one of Wills' patented scholarly works than a devotional one. He, like many contemporary Christians (many of whom find no place within Churches) has an obsessive need to get close to Jesus. This book is an attempt to cut through the gauze of our misplaced certainty about Christ to look at him with fresh eyes. More often than his critics would contend, Wills presents a Jesus that is probably as close as we can ever come to the enigmatic man whom two billion Christian s call Lord.Wills hooked me from the first page. His depiction of Koine Greek - the language of the New Testament - as a kind of pidgin language, missing the connectives and articles of classical Greek -- was captivating, if not entirely convincing. It was fascinating to imagine Christ and Pilate struggling to converse in a kind of ""You Kingee Jews?"" broken Greek that would have caused laughter to their educated contemporaries. Wills gives a few examples of his own word-for-word scriptural translations that seem very rough indeed. Most of his other examples, however, are much less rough, making me wonder whether he was making too much of this thesis.Wills turns to the Jesus story with the same hit-or miss blend of brilliance and improbability that he used with Koine Greek.Wills is as unhappy with just about everybody. He dislikes the scholars of the Jesus Seminar and has little use with traditional images of Christ provided by the Churches, especially his own Roman Catholic Church. The former group, Wills says, ""tames the real, radical Jesus, cutting him down to their size."" Hear, hear. But the Churches have swathed Jesus in such a cocoon of divinity, otherworldliness and innocuousness that his radical message cannot escape. To Wills' immense credit, he recognizes that the only Jesus we have is the Jesus of faith, transmitted to us through the conduit of the teaching of the apostles and the early Church. One great insight is to remind us that the apostles never say more about the historical Jesus than he actually was. They always say less. Understanding that the apostles could never fully capture the essence of their encounter with Christ is an important key to the gospels. These books, faced with the challenge of depicting the God-man, relied on stories whose message was not in the narrative vehicles used to tell the story, but in what the stories meant. For Wills then, as for many modern bible scholars, the greater truth is not the details of (for instance) who visited whom on the first Christmas, but in what the Nativity stories say about Christ as being a nobody from nowhere, put on the run by power from the start.Wills' most controversial conclusions revolve around his contention that Jesus did not come to start a church or to establish a hierarchy. He goes to great pains to show that the words for hierarchical priesthood are rarely if ever present in the New Testament. He returns again and again to Christ's cleansing of the temple. He takes that action, with good reason, as Christ's rejection of hierarchies and sacrificial systems that ossify truth and reduce the encounter with God into an efficient system. Yet Wills seems to forget that we are not Jesus. To imagine a movement based on religious anarchy, as Wills sees Jesus trying to do, seems mad. And yet the alternative, a self-sustaining priesthood that seems at odds with its founder, is often the result.Wills is repulsed by the inevitable errors of priesthoods, which ""keep on creating categories of the unclean"" that were clearly anathema to Jesus himself. Jesus broke down barriers, eating with the unclean, the sinful and the turncoat. Yet maddeningly, his followers can't help turning away their own ""unclean"" from the altar.What to do with Wills? Clearly, such a tortured seeker after Christ must have a place in our Churches. And while Wills's Jesus is the most persuasive of the many Jesuses one encounters on the page or on the screen, he cannot be sustained in a world bounded by time and custom. It may be that we are doomed to ever break out of one shell of Jesusolatry after another until the Parousia. While Wills's book ultimately fails to definitively provide the answer to ""What Jesus Meant,"" there is much in it of the faithful disciple and of the Master who is the disciple's goal. The book is full of counter-intuitive insights (Jesus as physically frail?) that shock us into examining our own assumption and biases. And as such, caveats and all, Wills' work cannot be dismissed.",book

961,"Andy was dragged into this war after finishing college, the good news is he wasn&#8217;t in the &#8216;Army&#8217; for very long and was transferred to the Stars and Strips a newspaper for the ETO soldiers. Andy spent a lot of his starting days in the war with the 305th Airborne and has a ton of great stories that you really have to read twice before you get the gravity of how any of this could be real. Andy then travels through Normandy to Paris and is there for the liberation of Paris and talks about how that was the greatest celebration he ever saw in his life. He said the celebration here in the States when the war was over was close but because we were never occupied at home by foreign soldiers the joy just wasn&#8217;t to the same level.I hung on every word of this book and was constantly amazed at it.

So here's another one from Al Adamson, who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film-making since the ""Blood of Dracula's Castle"" days. Where that earlier effort is a more or less totally sclerotic lump, this one mixes it up a little, adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence. Sure half of the movie is a blind post-op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse, but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind, or Nurse Sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork, or a wee bit of abstract student-film quick cutting to go with the pulsing-blob effects in the possession scene, or the most gratuitously half-hearted topless bit ever, or god knows what else (I forget, to be honest).

965,"I knew this game had to be very good. Not because I am any sort of TSR fan, or anything. But simply because of the fact that I knew over 600 playtesters had spent well over two years working on this game. Also because the folks at TSR were actually listening to the playtesters, something some companies fail to do. The book is very nice, full color, over 280 pages. All in all the size of a standard White Wolf main rule book, ten dollars cheaper than a White Wolf book, and did I mention FULL COLOR. The organization seemed somewhat clunky, maybe because I was used to 2nd Edition, they also seemed to repeat themselves often. When I first read the book I thought these repeats were quite annoying, but in reality they are very useful. First it makes you remember the rules, because you hear them so often. Secondly the rules are repeated where the rules are needed, cutting down on page flipping. Over all I would say it was put together really well. I thought all of the classes were very well designed, and while balanced, all the classes were very different and had different roles to play. I like that the game, much like Alternity, runs on the same core mechanic. It seems very cohesive, much more than the older editions. The few problems I have had with the book are these. It seems that, although D&amp;D3E is trying to break convention, Half-Orc's seem cursed to be simple fighting machines. I thought Monks were a poor choice of character class, and don't seem to fit the Quazi-European Fantasy D&amp;D3E was designed for. The new PHB is designed with Greyhawk in mind, making those of us playing Forgotten Realms in for a little tweaking of the rules. Lastly the glue the book is made out of seems to be weak, for my pages started popping out of the cloth binding on the inside cover. Now I will admit no pages came out, the pop-up did not go through the whole book binding, and some home surgery with Super-Glue fixed the problem. But it was somewhat annoying. My real pleasure was when one late night, I created a character and threw him up against a pair of Goblins (Found in the nice mini-rules insert in the back of the book). The new combat rules work nice for minatures, and that old AD&amp;D fealing came back during the fight.

967,"I went to see this film out of curiosity, and to settle an argument. The film is now best known from the suite of music Sergei Prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film, the Troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements. The general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings. A clerk accidentally generates a non-existent Lieutenant Kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar. The tsar is interested in this person, and rather than tell him he doesn't exist, the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real. Kizhe is exiled to Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, is given a state funeral, revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks.<br /><br />I had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented Kizhe, involving ink blots and sneezes, but I'd heard the film was lost, so there was no way to find out what happens. Then the film turned up at the Barbican in London as part of their Prokofiev festival. For the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns Kuzhe into Kizhe. As the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there's no time to correct the mistake.<br /><br />Having gone expecting an historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny, and the audience, myself included, laughed continuously. Although most of it is filmed straight, set mostly in the palace, there are a few ""trick"" shots where multiple images appear on the screen. For instance, the tsar's army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen. Four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison. Two identical servants scrub the floor.<br /><br />One slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was. There were two women who might have been the tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. And very few people were named. But all in all, an enjoyable film and I'm surprised it's not seen more often.",movie

The chicken is unbelievable. The skin is thin and flavorful and each piece is sauced and fried to absolute perfection. There must be wizards working in the kitchen because even after 45 minutes of the wings sitting on our table, the chicken sauce did not cause the skin to get soggy, which... science??? See, I told you it was unbelievable.

As for sauces, we ordered the Korean Sweet Chili, Soy Garlic, and Spicy Garlic Fish Sauce. We were blown away by all of them. My ONLY disappointment was I would have really appreciated a honey sauce of some sort, but hey, at least I'm aware that I'm needy, right?

We also ordered kimchi rice with spam and shrimp which was different than anything else I've had, and was incredibly tasty and filling.

Judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals, not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but a grossly mistaken man, horribly misguided in his zeal. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed--very human while also divine.

974,"THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance. In a turbulent career of just fifteen years, he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater, both as a performer and a creative producer, actor, and director. Although this movie might not appeal to many viewers, the film has much to offer. The storyline is fairly straightforward. A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems, and proves unable to control his downward spiral. THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS is shot with a slavish devotion to elegant detail, and each set is very carefully designed and constructed. Every object on set seems painstakingly arranged so as to provoke layers of emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to Hans's desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life. Much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama. Several times during the film, I froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shot's composition. I streamed this film, and the print was nearly flawless and second to none. Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement ""Anti-Natural' style. He does everything possible to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial manner, and this creates a rather stilted effect. However, by doing so, he injects an almost 'hyper-reality' to the narrative. Rather than the presentation of a mundane melodrama, the actors almost militant lack of affectation forces the viewer to confront the film in a different manner. Fassbinder's film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters' trials and tribulations. You are constantly on the outside, looking in. This will be a disconcerting experience for many, but I found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.",movie

980,"The Time Machine starts in New York during 1899 where Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) proposes to his beloved girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory) who accepts, unfortunately just after they are attacked by a mugger & Emma is shot dead & dies in Alexander's arms. Jump forward 'Four Years Later' & Alexander has built a time machine which he uses to travel back to the night Emma was killed in order to save her but she is still killed, only a different way this time. Alexander realises whatever he does, however many times he goes back Emma will always end up dead one way or another & he yearns to know the answer why so he travels far into the future to discover the truth. However after having destroyed the moon two new races have evolved on Earth, the human like Eloi & the monstrous Morlock's that eat the Eloi. Alexander decides to stick around & save the Eloi.<br /><br />Directed by Simon Wells who is actually the great grandson of author H.G. Wells who wrote the original The Time Machine book on which the original The Time Machine (1960) film was based & it is in fact the 1960 film that producer John Logan's script is based upon here rather than Wells original literally source. While all three share the same basic story & ideas this remake adds the subplot about Alexander's fianc√© Emma being killed & that's the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever & he can. The script is a mixture of sci-fi, action adventure & drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much, sure there are a few pretty special effects, a few nice action scenes & the moment when Alexander's question is answered regarding why he can't save Emma is actually quite intelligent & makes sense it never really captured my imagination & I was never really moved by it either. The time travel aspects of The Time Machine feel very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense you can't change the past but at the same time the future is not set only The Time Machine isn't anywhere near as good a film as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character's are alright although I thought Guy Pearce just looked too young to be a brainy scientist capable of inventing a time machine & there's never any real explanation behind it's mechanics either as it's like one moment there's no time machine the next he has invented & made one & it works perfectly. I reckon the Back to the Future trilogy offer far more thrills, laughs, excitement & general entertainment value than The Time Machine ever does & while I will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace, tells a reasonable story & has it's moments I wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the book & original film which are both name-checked here.<br /><br />The benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects & in particular CGI which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around Alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built, new ridges, canyons & mountains being formed & a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effects work is good, there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on telly & the station playing it badly pan and scanned it so the left & right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on Alexander's time machine dial so I actually didn't know what year he went to. Apparently director Gore Verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming as Wells was suffering from 'extreme exhaustion' while the IMDb says that the time machine itself was the biggest & most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which I find hard to believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but like a trooper carried on.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 the production values are high with a lovingly recreated period New York & good effects work although amazingly The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best make-up but lost out to Frida (2002). The acting is mixed, Jermey Irons puts in a good performance in a terrible make-up job that has him looking like a reject from a Lord of the Rings film while singer Samantha Mumba makes her big screen debut here & is simply terrible although Guy Pearce is quite good & fairly likable.<br /><br />The Time Machine isn't a particularly bad film or a particularly good one, just a somewhat unremarkable one that is watchable & passes an hour and a half but not much else.

Anyway, he followed along as the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships Martha formed .... Unattended boys coming of age without a mother around to help and a dad who was always looped ...<br /><br />Plus the fact that they portray the real Martha as if she were a movie star... she was a cute sweet girl next door type.

Beware that parking is really crammed and limited. 

Hot Pot Combo for two: We had half base and half spicy. The broth is really fulfilling. The base broth is pretty bland but the meats and vegetables really give it flavor. Their spicy broth was my favorite. Spicy broths add a kick of flavor. Our waitress came by often asking if we would like a refill. Their house made noodles were DELICIOUS! I wanted to eat just the noodles.

986,"That movie while slightly flawed was entirely entertaining. About half an hour into Be Cool, I started to have Hollywood Homicide flashbacks. But guess what? This is worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the cast in this movie, so that makes me feel bad about writing a negative review of it but I feel obligated. The Rock, Andre 3000, and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. No one else seemed to decide what movie genre they were acting in. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty to this movie. He was totally consistent in the role, but this movie is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a sore thumb. I was going to give this movie 4/10 because I like the actors so much but there is a conversation in the movie about a certain song that is so asinine I couldn't believe the performers actually said it. If you want to go to the movies this weekend there should still be some Oscar contenders out there. That would be a much better way to spend your time.",movie

988,"The Wedding Planning for Dummies is an easy read with plenty of humor and illustrations from the author, which I thought was not only entertaining but rather useful. The book is intentionally written as a reference so I can easily skim through the first time and then go back to the table of contents or index to locate which aspect of wedding planning I wanted more information on. It was pretty thorough from how to tie a bowtie to how to have the wedding cake be a focal point. In each section it was also helpful by its format to help the reader identify the key points, reminders, and tips. I enjoyed the book and felt it was helpful to plan weddings.There are definitely alot of things to consider before putting wedding together and I think this book does a good job in taking something that could be complex be somewhat palatable for a person who has never planned a wedding before. I actually have planned weddings and hope to write a book someday perhaps to plan a wedding on a budget. I hope to add the same humor and enthusiasm as well.",book

998,"I remember being terrified of movie blood when I was younger, and gradually getting less so, until getting jaded enough, as I'm sure many other viewers have become, so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm. ""The Dentist"" turned that around.<br /><br />The setup seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths, and perhaps bodies as well. A clever twist, though, is that the dentist is the film's protagonist, so instead of being some one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation, his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable. The viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims, and instead of hoping for justice to come to him, I found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life.<br /><br />What really ""makes"" a horror movie is the violence. And ""The Dentist"" does it better than any other film I can think of. First off, the film has tons of tension, which is something that modern gore films tend to lack. In one scene (), the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time. As he reaches into the child's mouth, you hope that, for the dentist's and the child's sake, the encounter ends without injury. I won't spoil what happens. Second, when the gore does come, it hits all the worst, squirmy nerves. Once again, I won't give anything away.<br /><br />Of course, being a movie that you've never heard of, it does have flaws. Most importantly, it's exclusively for horror fans. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, by taking place over a span of just a few days, we don't really get any background on the characters. And the tension drops a little bit during the very end. But really, the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is, and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven.<br /><br />It's strange, after years of being accustomed to movie gore, to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood. ""The Dentist"" made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable, and for this it earns my full approval.",movie

Sometimes it is more like work, worth the effort, but not easy or even totally pleasurable.This book is simply a gas: a high speed, surrealistic excursion through four centuries of the role of women and men in English society, and Woolf's writing is in turn caustic, brilliant, lyrical, funny, transcendent and astonishing.If you are going to read one great work of 20th century literature, this should be on your short list.",book
1000,"In Robert Hamburger's freshman novel - Real Ultimate Power: The official Ninja Book, Hamburger delves deeply into an alternate reality that is commonly hidden from the view of man kind.Throughout our lives we are constantly preoccupied with what we deem to be important and proper so that we can live with meaning and happyness. What the psyche often forgets is how sweet ninjas are. Hamburger develops this novel (it is more like a study of mankind) carefully, and intricately weaves his words and thoughts in accordance to the highest forms of spiritual law and mental awareness. This precise attention to the details of the subconscience, the super ego, the fundamental lament of the hippo, and its quintesential parter the Ninja, is totally sweet in this book, and by totally sweet I mean like the 3rd level of conciousness augmented to a minor third by Charlie Parker in some old club where the one guy in the audience flips out hard and projectile vomits on his mom.This book not only is somthing that we should read everyday, we should read this to babies in the womb as well as to the people who are so close to passing in nursing homes that they can only eat through a tube and breath heavily. Since this book teaches us all how we can truely live a full and spiritually perfect life while accomplishing what we need on the physical plane of life, I will not be surprised if this book will promt the starting of a large religious following.Like books such as the Bible, the Koran, and The oddesy, this book is one that will truely change the history of mankind and the world. Its great power is difficult to comprehend in the very limited understanding of the miniscule human brain, but overhead and all through us the voices of the angels and spiritual beings can be heard praising through sacred murmers and rich warm tones the glory and power that this book truely is.So let us not delay in beholding this book and the prophet, Robert Hamburger who has graced us with these words of infinite wisdom and love.Not only will I personally read this book everyday in my life, I will read it to the world. I will read it to the starving in ethiopia so that they may have food, I will read it to the cocain addicts on the streets of L.A. so that they may throw off the clutches of evil addiction, I will read it to the rich man who hast been possesed and ravaged by the unholy notion of greed.This book shall be read to all upon their arrival to heaven!",book

Dean Stockwell is doing a Jack Nicholson-thing with a squint, and he gets a nomination for it! Plus we have to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians?

The drinks were really good.  I had the Despacito and my friend had an old fashioned with mezcal, I forget the name. The chips with sauces that came out were really good. 

For starters we got buttermilk friend shrimp and empanadas. The shrimp was really not good. It was soggy, and the shrimp tasted like it was frozen and defrosted in a not good way. I didn't care for the empanada but my friend liked it. 

For mains I got the fish taco and a cauliflower taco, it was taco Tuesday so you could order different tacos. I thought they both pretty good. My friend had the short rib quesadilla, and was also good.  

There are better options s for this type of food, so not sure I'm dying to go back. But the location is really good so maybe when I'm back in the area.

It's a new concept flew over from Hollywood. So it's not a new item.<br /><br />1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and he claims to be her boyfriend.<br /><br />Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When she yells, I get annoyed. Salman khan cannot play comic roles. But in his serious parts he is marvelous.<br /><br />2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman, with forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and kids.<br /><br />Anil kapoor en Juhi are natural born actors / actresses. They are great. But this story is to thin for them.<br /><br />3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) is going to get married to Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off.<br /><br />4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She gets an accident and suffers a memory loss. Now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore.<br /><br />5. Raju (Govinda) is a cab driver. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz) who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian male but he is about to get married with an Indian woman. Raju has to bring Staphani to that man, but falls in love with her.<br /><br />I never liked Govinda's movies. He is very annoying, not funny. But in this movie I liked him very much, like he has been growing up the last years.<br /><br />6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal who is just married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He want to get some serious action with her, but every time her family comes in between.<br /><br />Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! I like his movies.<br /><br />Now here's the problem. All these stories aren't interesting. To make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories touch each other, but is not significant for the characters.<br /><br />My conclusion; Priyanka cannot act! Loose that woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more movies, this role for him was too small. Salman Khan cannot act comic roles, but real serious movies. That's written on his life as an actor. This movie sucks, and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham.<br /><br />It's just like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you only let him sing a lullaby.",movie

This is hardly history, and could be more accurately described as pure propoganda. Aside from being largely factually incorrect, this book is nothing more than an opportunity for a militant feminist to spout her rantings. Our class noted an unbelievable error on p.150 in the book. It stated that 10 million soldiers fought for the Confederacy and that one-fourth of those soldiers (2.5 million) perished. This is ridiculous. At the time, only nine million people lived in the South, and on both sides only 600,000 people lost lives.

1007,"Like most people, I was interested in ""More"" solely because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which has turned out to be the only Pink Floyd album that I still listen to after all these years. It was quite a surprise to run across the film in a local video store, in a digitally remastered version. It was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie.<br /><br />Visually it is quite beautiful, especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of the soundtrack music, which as far as I can tell is exclusively by Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me, mentally ticking off each track as it was used in the film. Dave Gilmour's brief ""A Spanish Piece"" was the only one I didn't hear, and several tracks are used quite prominently, especially ""Cymbaline,"" ""Main Theme,"" and ""Quicksilver."" That latter track is tedious on the soundtrack album but works very well during the title sequence of the film, resurfacing at least once later on. Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, now that I have some visuals to accompany it in my mind.<br /><br />The plot of ""More"" is a little hard to take at times, especially in the early going, when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the hipness of those involved in making it. But eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer, as the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does ANYBODY take heroin, fully knowing the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer that question directly, but Stefan's heroin use seems a logical extension of his single-minded pursuit of pure pleasure.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this film to any Pink Floyd fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated ""More"" soundtrack. I also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties counterculture and how it was portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this movie is, since I am too young to have experienced the sixties firsthand, but it does seem to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other movie does.",movie
1008,"Came to The Victor for my dear friend's birthday brunch. We had a party of 8 people.

Firstly, the setting and ambiance was beautiful. Right at the entrance was their candy bar, you can grab a piece or two on the way in or out.
We got seated near the windows so there was a lot of natural lighting which I enjoyed very much.

Our group decided to order a couple of items to share for the table. So we tried some of their western-style brunch dishes, sushi, and got 2 sides of their infamous mac n cheese waffles. All of the food was good! I particularly enjoy the Victor steak and eggs - the filet mignon was nicely cooked to a medium rare. 
I quite enjoyed their French toast but I found I lacking a bit. They used wonderful slices of brioche and served it with Nutella whipped cream and a Hazelnut brittle. It was a bit boring though, I would've enjoyed some fruit on top or a brittle + nut mix.
The sushi actually tasted very fresh. They were nicely rolled and presented.

Service was wonderful. The hostess and waiter were friendly and accommodating. Though we did wait quite a while after ordering (35 mins) before our food came - but that's understandable as we were a big group and ordered quite a bit.

Yes, the prices are above average - I think it's worth it for some items but not so much for some others. They do use some more 'common ingredients' such as the Nutella whipped cream and Solly's bagels. Food didn't taste AMAZING but it was pretty good. Overall, I had a pleasant experience at The Victor. I would recommended checking it out as they do offer a diverse brunch menu. And the mac n cheese waffles were really tasty!",restaurant

1015,"Even though I'm quite young, The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE band! I never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since I can remember.<br /><br />It's the sort of film that is worth trying the once. I can see why it wasn't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the TV. I was flicking through my TV guide and happened to see this film, it didn't much details except something like, 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles have broken up, Jared Harris Stars'. I'd never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However they are certainly underestimated actors!<br /><br />The film had a slow start but as it developed, I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters. As a huge fan, I sort of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like. The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and mannerisms spot on! Quinn played McCartney quite well but sometimes went into his Irish accent. THe make-up artists made them look excellent.<br /><br />THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE COUNTED AS A *SPOILER*:<br /><br />As I mentioned before, it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film. I found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians. As for Lennon's rude line in the Italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. The ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever I watch it.<br /><br />It is quite different from the other biographical films I've seen where it's about how The Beatles got together and became famous, and those never really did the characters that well. E.g. 'Backbeat'.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would say, if you're a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise. At only about 95 minutes long, it's worth waiting for the film to develop.<br /><br />If anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page' for this film, I'd be very interested.",movie

But we often forget that history unfolds just like today. There is no logic to the flow of events. Things happen that cannot be easily explained. We can accept that two army buddies can blow up a building, that an ex-football star could/could not have brutally slashed his wife, but not that a disgruntled ex-Marine with an Marxist obsession could have murdered JFK without a vast conspiracy behind him, or that a struggling Jewish nightclub owner could have been so distraught that he chose to take matters into his own hands, or that government agencies like the FBI and the CIA could have tried to cover-up their mistakes and evade blame, or that eye-witnesses could have changed their version of events to gain noteriety. As a nation we've closed our eyes to the truth for too long. Myth-making has replaced rational understanding of irrational events. Posner skillfully puts these events into perspective and attempts to explain our continuing denial of what really happened.

If a story is as personal as this supposedly was to Sally Potter, wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance? Her acting was completely detached and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance, were instead awkward and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting, and as such Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness.",movie
1022,"I like Basil's, especially their outdoor dining area. I most recently dined here in November during the Covid pandemic. I had brunch outside with friends on a Sunday. There were just about 2-3 other parties outside and inside was empty aside from the bar. 

I had the lamb burger with fries which was average as far as lamb burgers go, however I couldn't stop eating off my friend's plate. She had the creme br√ªl√©e french toast which was exactly what my brunch dreams are made of. It was the perfect amount of sweet and tasted just like creme br√ªl√©e. Sadly, they dropped the ball on her order and forgot her side of eggs and bacon.

We also had a few starters like the crab bites (definitely worth a try) and the calamari which was also pretty good. We were bummed to find out they no longer offer bottomless mimosas. 

I've dined here for lunch in the past too and had the lamb shawarma wrap which was perfect with their crispy fries. And their cocktails are on point!

The only downside on my most recent brunch visit was that service was so slow. We actually had to ask a few times if our orders were put in and a few times we couldn't find our server. I can't wait to come back and get my own order of french toast!",restaurant
1023,"Personal finance is a subject rarely taught in schools, and so it's understandable that many may be uncomfortable when they have to face their financial situations. This book is for those people who feel as though they don't have control over their money and financial goals, and don't know where to turn to in order to get that control. There are many other books out there, mainly motivational, that prey on such readers, but they hardly give any practical or useful advice. Rather, they tell you what you already know intuitively, and make you think that you're hearing it for the first time. You don't gain any more understanding, and you don't change your bad habits.Eric Tyson helps you to learn about ways to save, invest, and buy insurance. He doesn't fluff up the book with lame, tangential stories. He doesn't try to sound profound when speaking simple truths. He sounds more like a teacher who is just trying to explain the basics of sound financial behavior. If you know a lot about personal finance, there may not be much that is new here; it's a ""dummies"" book after all. But all the advice is well grounded and he explains it well. Of course, some people will disagree with some things. Perhaps you don't want to invest in mutual funds (which he enthusiastically recommends) and would rather play the market by researching individual companies on their own or day trading according to message board tips. But to advise that would be ridiculous. For all the time and hassle involved, the average person may not realize any returns doing that. For the average person, mutual funds are a very good way of earning healthy returns in the long run, without much effort.I found his chapters on retirement accounts and insurance to be most helpful, but only because I didn't know much about the topics. He doesn't get too in-depth, understandably, but he covers the topics with enough detail to enlighten a financial dummy into acting wisely. I highly recommend this book to those who want to learn safe and conservative ways to handle their money and want to gain a clear understanding of how to evaluate their own financial health. It's a good place to start, but don't stop your financial education here. Keep reading! And even if you do think you know everything, skimming through this at the library might still be useful.I'm reviewing the 2nd edition, by the way. The 3rd edition appears to have about 70 more pages, and I'm looking forward to reading it soon.",book
1024,"Vonnegut's Novel Noir, which revolves around the devastating effects of the 1945 bombardment of Dresden, depicts the disturbed mental existence of Billy Pilgrim---a pathetic anti-hero with whom we soon sympathize. Readers are jerked through multiple time warps in each chapter of these 215 pages of stream-of-consciousness memories. To further compound literary comprehension portions of chapters one and ten are related by a first-person narrator whose goal is to comment on Billy's story. In short: his fluctuating inner life deposits him without warning into pieces of temporal amber, trapping him like a bug, where he is helpless to return to the present. The choice of the protagonist's name is indicative of his plight: BILLY implies not a fully grown man but an impotent youth; PILGRIM hints at his psychological journeys in search of sanity--or even his attempts to escape it.Requiring some literary flexibility on the part of readers this story is engaging; we see Billy in a variety of ages and settings (not the least bit chronological). Flashbacks are not sufficient; the author includes flash forwards as well. No wonder poor Billy is often confused. We see him as a baby, a boy, a fianc&eacute;, then a rich optometrist, a devoted husband, and a wretched chaplain's assistant during WW2. The poor fellow permits himself to be acted upon, rather than commit himself to deliberate action, which results in needless suffering for him--not to mention the dismayed concern of his adult offspring. Meekly accepting of his fate and the prolonged unfairness of life, he calmly allows the world to consider him a crackpot by insisting that he was abducted by aliens and displayed in a an Earthling cage on a planet called Tralfamadore.Besides spoofing the sci fi craze of the 1960's the author indulges in two private agendas: to educate the American public about the atrocity of Dresden and to titillate the masses with countless examples of lewd language and crass behavior. He assumes that intelligent Americans will revel in his indulgence of low morality and crudity--cleverly passed off as literature. We must wade through a morass of filth (of all kinds) in order to empathize with the trials of a nave innocent like Billy, whose pilgrim journey of self-discovery and human acceptance may never be fully achieved. An interesting read for those who can separate the trash from the kernels of human truth.",book
1025,"I've heard a lot about Porno Holocaust and its twin film Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time on the same location with the same actors changing clothes for each film (and taking them off). If you are expecting the D'Amato genius displayed in films like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you won't find it here. Nonetheless this film has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist. Where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie/monster and his enormous penis that strangles and chokes women to death? Only from D'Amato. There is some amount of gore in which many of the men are bludgeoned to death. The film is set on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know there is no subtitled version, so if you don't speak Italian you wont know what is going on...but who cares right? In all honesty, Gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex. And if anyone is actually watching this for the sex only, will for sure be offended instantly. I can just imagine modern day porn fans tracing back through D'Amato's output and coming across this atrocity! Out of the two I find Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead far superior. But, don't bother watching either if they are cut. Porno Holocaust is extremely low budget as expected. Even the monster looks no where as good as George Eastman's character in Anthropophagus. The film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your D'Amato film quest.",movie

The portion size was just right and it came with a generous amount of curds. The fries were fried to a nice golden brown and soaked up the gravy nicely.

One day, while walking to my NYC apartment, I saw Stacy Keach shooting a scene for his TV series, Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to chat, and I told him how much I enjoyed THE DION BROS, and considered it a pure classic. He thanked me, and said it was one of the best, and most memorable film experiences of his career.

1031,"After I ordered and received this book, I discovered that it was different from the one that was discussed in reviews that I had read. It turns out that the reviews that I got most of my information from were apparently for a different European phrasebook (or maybe another edition of this one), also by Lonely Planet (I think), which includes several languages not in this one. (For some reason, reviews are applied to both books at the Amazon site.) This book includes Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish. It does NOT have Basque, Catalan, Dutch, Irish, Maltese, Welsh, or another language or two that I might have seen mentioned. It is pretty informative, but I believe the other book has more info in it. While I can't help feeling kind of disappointed, I still think this is a pretty neat, pretty handy little book. 15 languages is still impressive. I really appreciate the pronunciation guides. I just wish I had ordered a copy of the other book, like I thought I had. Oh well. Maybe I'll get one later; I'll just have to continue enjoying this one in the meantime. I should have taken a closer look at this book's cover and the product description before I ordered it, so I do have to place most of the blame for my disappointment on myself. (Update: Turns out that the other book is a Mass Market Paperback version, and the only languages that the two books have in common are French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.)",book
1032,"I had to take off one star in my rating, because this book is a bit frustrating at times. But if you are sincerely seeking to understand the true nature of God, this book may give you a good idea of what each side is teaching. I recommend that people read this book for themselves before believing any of the accusations that have been made here or anywhere else.Some folks have said that it takes years of study before you can understand Calvinism, and this may be true...but I would like to remind each reader of some important biblical facts: when the Apostle Paul was writing to young Timothy, he wrote ""from a CHILD thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus"" (2 Timothy 3:15).Furthermore, Jesus also made it clear that He has a message which even a child can understand (See Matthew 18:3-4 and Mark 10:14-15). That said, I hope it will become clear to each reader that the message of the Bible is not so complicated...it only seems complicated when man complicates it.I think that the sincere reader will find that there is simplicity in Christ (See 2 Corinthians 11:3). With these simple facts in mind, I think the sincere reader of this book will find the simple truth he or she is searching for.I do not want to cause division here, and I am not asking you to take Dave Hunt's word for it, I am not asking you to take James White's word for it, and I am not even asking you to take my word...I am only asking you to take God's word for it, because God's word is the final word. I am asking each reader to humble yourself before the Lord if you know that you haven't, and read this book in simple child-like faith.I am asking you to be like the Bereans in Acts 17:10-11, who ""received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so"".I am a simple minded guy, but I believe that the Bible was written for common people. That should be clear from some of the Scriptures that I have shared here. May God use this book to bless everyone who is sincerely seeking His true nature in simple child-like faith and humility.",book

1036,"I was blubbing like an idiot during the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television. I have to say that the idea of sitting down to view 90 minutes of what was bound to be pretty depressing material on a Sunday, was not a welcome one. The thought of yet another, over worthy, BAFTA winning possibility did not enthuse me......However the end result knocked me for 6. This is some of the best television I have seen in ages. For years I was under the impression that all originality had left the BBC's drama department. Our Friends in the North was the last production that truly blew me away and that was 10 years ago. However faith is restored and honour is satisfied. David Tenant was incredible! So many actors I can think of would have really gone to town on a part like this, but never once did I see Mr Tenant as an actor or as the Doctor, all I saw was Alan Hamilton. I haven't had my heart wrenched this much since Daniel Craigs performance as Geordie Peacock all those years ago. Sarah Parish was also incredible and I really hope this role brings her better roles in the future. All of the cast were great but special mention must go to the director who really placed us inside Alans head. The toaster scene, in particular, made me feel quite queasy.",movie

I love the allusions to Mozart all throughout from the opening with ""Einstein"" playing ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of the Ed Walters. I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, an especially unique situation for the 1950's, the time in which this movie is set. (I myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children, so please don't think I am some staunch women's libber.) It's wonderful how a man who is ""only a grease monkey"" is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as Catherine's fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. There are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.<br /><br />I did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene when Ed Walters is to speak at symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge. In the next camera shot, there only 2. In the credits on our video, it lists Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.

1042,"This story was probably one of the most powerful I have ever taken in. John Singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances by the whole cast, but Epps and Rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star's career.<br /><br />However, as a college student myself, many of the issues that Singleton touched on were taken to the extreme. In a sense that, while they are issues faced on many college campuses, they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe. In some instances, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur. However, aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think. One of the things from this picture I will remember forever, was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character, ""Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you cannot see your power."" Brilliant, just brilliant.",movie
1043,"It amazes me how Burroughs could change the scenes of his stories in so many ways, without changing the story itself.This time, the mysterious and unexplored land is the inner surface of a hollow Earth. David Innes reaches it via an ill-explained ""prospector,"" created in secret by super-scientist Perry. This digging machine is to soil what a submarine is to water, so off they go on the first trial of the machine and its super-motor. They go way off, farther than they ever imagined.Pellucidar, that planet-within-a-planet, hosts Innes's adventure for the next decade. Its nightless sky illuminates a world apparently undergoing the same evolution seen on the surface, nearly in lock-step, but with eras crossing each other in merry abandon. That gives plenty of time for bronto-riding cavemen, hulking and hirsuit half-men, pterodactyls, and fiendishly intelligent dinosaurians - the anthropophagi obligatory in a tale of this type. And, as is the ERBish habit, there's a damsel in distress, a baffling romance thwarted by chivalric misunderstandings, and the sneaking traitor, kept close at hand for those frequent moments when a dramatic act of treachery needed to take the place of logical progression. And yes, the super-scientific explorers end up fighting with swords.If this were a movie, it would call out for a rainy Saturday and a bucket of popcorn.

1048,"PotluckBy Jack RudloeBook ReviewBy Richard E. NobleMy wife and I live in Eastpoint Fl. Eastpoint is known as the oyster capital of Florida. My wife and I caught oysters for our livelihood for over a decade. We were ""oyster people"" or seafood workers. Our neighborhood is filled with shrimpers and crabbers and seafood workers of all types and kinds. The characters in this book are my neighbors and fellow workers.The Eastpointer: Life In A Sleepy, Little Fishing VillageMr. Rudloe does an excellent job in capturing us seafood workers as we really are. And I know why he was able to accomplish this. He lives in Panacea which is just east of Eastpoint where I live and write my books. He works hand in hand with seafood workers. He has worked as a shrimper on shrimp boats. He has spent much of his life in this seafood district, living and working side by side with seafood workers. He knows the people that he has described in this work. I am sure that every character in this book is based on a real life person that Jack has known from the neighborhood.Mr. Rudloe has established a marine laboratory in Panacea. He is a scientist by occupation and a fiction writer by avocation. He and his wife write books of a technical nature on marine biology. I have read and reviewed a few.Shrimp: The Endless Quest for Pink GoldWhat I enjoy most about Mr. Rudloe's books is his ability to speak to the common man. He makes science and marine biology fun to read. And in his fiction, likewise, I admire his ability to create down to earth, recognizable regular folks, living and playing in true to life fashion. This book is a perfect example of his ""common"" touch.The book is a work of fiction. But there was a time in this area when events such as those described in this work by the author were commonplace. Smuggling drugs in from the Gulf waters by shrimpers and seafood workers, even oystermen, went on. Bales of marijuana were found floating around in Apalachicola Bay, just outside my door.Everybody around this neighborhood knows about it and can give you many, many justifiable reasons why their cousin Floy, Roy or Coy may have been involved in this illegal practice. There are many adventure stories of this type and nature that can be told by many a small boat captain, now retired, living around here. I could write a few myself.I thought this book was great fun. For me it was hardly fiction and some of the stories and scenes described by the author, in my humble opinion, could warrant investigation by the proper authorities. I'm just kidding, of course. This is a work of fiction but written in such a manner that it is more than believable.I know this author and have met him personally. I had always considered him to be a scientist and a very knowledgeable person. I did not expect his fiction to be so entertaining, creative, realistic, and down right enjoyable.After you finish this book by Jack, you might like to try his other work of fiction ""Chicken Wars."" This is quite a satirical fantacy, once again, very unpredictable and extremely creative.CHICKEN WARSPotluck is a good one to read, lots of fun and entertainment and actually a little real history to boot.

1051,"In the history of movies based on comic books, ""Mystery Men"" is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). ""Mystery Men"" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like ""Superman"" or ""Batman,"" such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found ""Mystery Men"" to be visually stimulating and very funny.

1054,"Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in ""screaming teen"" clich√© horror with a more thriller-like pacing. In some ways Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably.<br /><br />Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster. Instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons. In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victims.<br /><br />As the name implies, the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.<br /><br />Through all this, the film makers also incorporated a lot of clich√©, which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing. This, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters who are, at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex.<br /><br />Technically the film has a lot of problems however. The cinematography, which is typically regarded highly, I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized, utilizing formulaic 2/3 approaches far too rigidly. Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also greatly over used.<br /><br />The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared, motivations are routinely unclear, and major plot points remain untied in the end.<br /><br />Overall, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over-stylized imagery, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.<br /><br />If the film were better executed, it would have been excellent. However, Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.",movie

1057,"Since ""Rugrats""' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years, obviously the tyrants at Klasky-Csupo should be out of ideas. After dumbing down all of the characters, adding even stupider new ones, replacing some voices (though I like Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chucky Finster!), and having no sense of continuity (ex.: in a Kimi episode I watched the other day, Tommy and Chucky each got a new puppy; but it subsequent episode, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy. But noooo.<br /><br />All I will say concerning this special is that it sucks! While not as horrible as the Kimi episodes, everyone is even stupider than they were, including Grandpa (my God! He used to be the best character on the show, but now, he has no real purpose). The ending is needlessly fluffy, and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ('98-'01) is that the kids can interact with adults. Whoa, what fun!<br /><br />No stars at all for ""The Rugrats All Growed Up"". Klasky-Csupo, please DESTROY this show before it gets any worse.",movie

1059,"For those of us who love a story with an historical setting, this is a wonderfully informative book. Set in the turbulence of 18th century England shortly after the burst of the South Sea Company bubble, Liss's antihero, Benjamin Weaver gives us a glimpse into the political scene of the day. Weaver, having escaped the horrors of Newgate Prison after being sentenced to death for a murder he never committed, lands himself in one dangerous situation after another trying to vindicate his name and prove his innocence.This is the second book Mr. Liss has written about the escapades of Weaver, a thieftaker in London under the reign of the Hanoverian King George I. The author brilliantly shows the sights and sounds of the seamy streets and tawdry taverns of the cities' east side where groups of ruffians roam the streets and death comes easily to the uninitiated. He also shows that prejudice against certain ethnic groups is nothing new in our century.After all the twists and turns, I felt the ending was a little lame but perhaps the author left an opening for another sequel and I would certainly be interested in reading more about the roguish Mr. Weaver.",book

1062,"Bad first experience
We ate there for the first time last week. I ordered a salad and my husband ordered a burger. Two bites into his burger he realized it was very pink inside and cold. My husband asked a server walking by to take it away. When our server came up moments later she asked where his burger was. He explained it was too pink and he lost his appetite. He said he didn't expect to pay for it. She said it wasn't undercooked, that that's how their burgers look inside and mistakes happen. She never did return to our table. Another girl finished up our meal. 

I've been in the food industry for years. When three tables sat after you get their meals before you, including pizzas and other burgers, and then you are served a cold, pink burger, it either means the server forgot to punch in the order or the cook lost the chit and now your burger was rushed. Take the time to cook food properly and don't give a b.s. answer to your guests. It's insulting.",restaurant

She thinks she is beautful, loves other men giving her attention, kisses well because she has done it often and has kissed back on many occasions.

She thinks he should keep his word and just go through with the marriage. Who would want to marry a shrew. Unfortunalty the hero does not heed my advice. (Dumb Man). This book fills its boring pages with them writing a book together. Thats boring also. And our so (wonderful) Fiona draws pictures of nudes. Woman in her era did not do things along those lines. It seemed so far fetched. it seemed perfectly natural to her but Johnathan and the cousin Oliver seemed to be a little stuffy regarding the issue.

1080,"This is a typically fast-moving entertaining movie of the early 1930s. When you have James Cagney in the lead, these ""pre-Code"" films are even better: just fun stuff to watch. Usually, when films are ""dated,"" it's a negative but not so with films from 1930-1934. Yeah, with the slang and the attitudes, dress, hairstyles, etc., they are dated but that's a big part of the fun. These films have an edge to them that almost always are fun to view.<br /><br />They also have a corniness which is appealing and fascinating. You see people - like the juvenile delinquents pictured in this film and their goofy parents - that you just don't see in any period but this one (early '30s). Early on this movie, the kids go before the judge and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of their kids, one after the other. Yes, we get the stereotypical emotional Italian father; the Jewish dad; the Anglo-Saxon mom and a few other moms who all, in dramatic form, plead theirs is ""a good boy."" Even though things are predictable in some cases, you don't mind because everyone in here is so much fun to watch.<br /><br />This also teaches you that kids were punks 75 years ago, too, stealing, robbing, mugging, lying - hey, that's the human condition. This movie debunks the theory that ""people were nicer back in the old days."" No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was aided by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here, we get a bunch of ""Dead End"" kids who wind up in Reform School.<br /><br />The ridiculous and stupidly-liberal storyline has kids acting immediately like angels once they run the show at the reform school; not punished in the slightest for causing a man to fall to his death and setting the institution on fire (the explanation: he was a meanie and deserved it. So much for real justice and reform.); and ""Patsy"" shooting a guy bit never having to even be questioned by police because he's the good guy! Notice the subtle anti-religious dig in which the only guy seen praying is the evil ""warden."" That's no coincidence, no accident. That sort of negative-association things has been going on ever since the Hays Code was canned in the late '60s and was seen, as you see hear, in the Pre-Code early '30s.<br /><br />Dudley Digges, by the way, is outstanding in his ""bad guy"" role of ""Mr. Thomson."" I especially his voice was very effective and could picture him playing one of those similarly-evil roles as an institution boss in a Charles Dickens film adaptation. Cagney played his normal role, the take-no-guff tough guy who gets the pretty girl, ""Dorothy Griffith,"" played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro also was effective as the leader of the boys, ""Jimmy Smith."" Just the looks on Darro's face alone made his character believable. Some thing he was the real star of the film, but I'll still go with Cagney. The rest of the reform school kids weren't too believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch.<br /><br />I thought the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in the court after the kids were arrested. Those scenes are pure 1930s Dead End Kids stuff. They always showed the kids to be bad news at the beginning of the film, but by the time the story was over they all looked acting more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - hardly rough ""delinquents."" It's very far-fetched but it works, entertainment-wise.<br /><br />Overall, a hokey but very entertaining movie, typical of Cagney films and those of the early '30s. Almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value.",movie

Biryani was good. It wasnt the best I ever had. But good. Compared to what we get in this area (Bawarchi, Viceroy, Moon, Bay Leaf) this is the best among all of them. 

Order take outs feel like a hassle. Our fellow biryani loving friends are too hungry and standing too close. Somehow they are thinking that if they come too close to the person in front of them, line moves fast. Odd people. These are guys who fight at ""The theater ticket line"". Then every one thinks they are a VIP and want to cut the line ""because they ordered online or on phone"". So special right? Well my friend, its a take out area.

1086,"I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I'd call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw ""Semi-Pro"" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next???",movie

1088,"I've read ""first novels"" and ""early effort books"" who's author's poor grammatical skills are ammended by their ability to tell a good story and produce characterization strong enough to involve the reader in spite of the book's faults. For such promising novels, I can excuse sentence structure like ""I knew your reaction would be worth coming out in this miserable rain for"" and I can forgive an occasional lazy redundancy of word choice found in a sentence like "" Her hips ground in to my face as she rode my face...""Unfortunately, In my opinion, the Fixer by Jon F. Merz is not such a novel. The character ""Lawson"" is presented to the reader as a seasoned covert operative. He is a vampire born of a race of vampires who coexist in the shadow of humanity as a separate and hidden species. Lawson's task as a fixer for the ( Vampire) council, is to police the activities of vampires who may reveal their species existence to mankind with the usual consequences - The much higher numbered human population would seek to ""destroy all monsters"" and upset the ""Balance"" between vampire predator and human prey.I don't consider this premise to be terribly original. The Fixer was published in 2002, and as an avid reader and film fan, I'd come across this underground vampire society concept well before it was popularized by the novels of Ann Rice in the 1980s. ( Even the Blade franchise follows a similar vein)But even a less than original premise can be excused if the story works and the characters are strong. Frankly, I've read along happily as well defined characters surmount the duel obstacles of poor plotting and flimsy world building to conclude a novel that shouldn't work technically, but does evoke empathy in the reader.My dissatisfaction with the FIXER is rooted in my view that the protagonist is not believable. ( And let's face it a readers of vampire novels have well flexed suspension- of- disbelief muscles ) I cannot accept Lawson as a centenarian, vampire with a human's life-time as a black Ops veteran in the face his sloppy detective work, poor operative decisions,( He readily tells love interest Talya, a human, that their mutual quarry is a vampire) and well... his constant whining. On several occasion during the first person narrative, Lawson describes himself as reacting ""like a fourteen year old boy"" to Talya. I find this to be an apt description of Lawson's behavior in general. Lawson's background and training is given as lengthy, Marine/special forces tough, dangerous and intensive. But for all of his training Lawson doesn't seem to know what to do in a tight spot and allows situations to worsen through his own failure to deliver. He repeatedly allows himself to be distracted and taken unawares by Talya and others. His approaches to his suspects are conducted with an admitted lack of skill, and little viable reason is given for these outrages breaches of form in so highly trained an operative.As the book continues and the missteps mount, Lawson's descriptions of his training and career come across as mere braggadocio, rather than expository character development.Of course, as in any novel, the protagonist can't succeed in his mission at this first attempts. ( that is if the book is to exceed 43 pages). However, in my opinion, ineptitude on the part of the main protagonist as a plot driver is a cop-out on the part of the author. It reveals a lack of skill and imagination. Which are essential attributes to a horror/ fantasy novelist.It's possible that the author wished to give Lawson and air of vulnerability. Perhaps even an element of humanity, by making him fallible. As Lawson repeatedly admits his fear of Cosgrove, I surmise, that this main antagonist character was meant to seem that much more menacing. He, Cosgrove, must be truly dangerous if a bad-ass such as Lawson could be frightened by him. Again, this might work if Lawson was convincingly bad-ass. Or if Cosgrove were less of a standard ""trying to take over the (vampire) world"" megalomaniac so common to comic books and daytime soap operas. Ultimately, I found that in the Fixer the author, through the character Lawson, talks a good game, but fails to deliver convincing characterization and good plotting.There are several more books in this series and I see very good Amazon reviews for these as well as the Fixer. I troubled myself to find and purchase The Fixer, which is currently out of print, hoping to find a gem and read the entire series. I Will not now purchase the remaining books.Although it is possible that, in later books, the author mended the mistakes of the first novel I find too little promise in the Fixer to drive my actions forward to purchase the next books.",book

1102,"I was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. Sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising Barney this much after the fifth grade?<br /><br />Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. I'm fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Kids? They LOVE this show.<br /><br />When I was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into.<br /><br />And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break.<br /><br />My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains. Of course there's Big Bird, Ernie, and Oscar, and they're great, too. But at the toddler stage, it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur. And that's enough for me.",movie
1103,"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands.",book

Come on.<br /><br />There was also quite a bit of implied sexual content, between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along - including a prostitute! <br /><br />The acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was 'stupid'.<br /><br />Despite having Elizabeth Shue, this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.",movie

1110,"I was intrigued when I came across this unassuming little book at a used bookstore. The plot revolves around the dual quest of Davies, one of the book's two protaganists. An Englishman and amateur yachtist, Davies' spot of autumn sailing along the challenging Frisian coast, Germany's narrow mouth on the sea facing England, turns into something more when a man ostensibly out to aid Davies by ""piloting"" his small craft with his larger yacht through an intricate network of sandbanks in harsh weather, actually makes an attempt to lead Davies and his boat to their doom along the treacherous coast. This act of deceit piques the indefatigable Davies' curiosity. What was so important among these nondescript sand islets fronting the German coast that would necessitate murder? This question is one object of Davies' subsequent quest. The other is a lover's quest, namely in the form of the daughter of the putative pilot just mentioned. To aid him in his foolhardly quest, considering his small yacht and the inclement weather of the North Sea in autumn, Davies summons from England his acquaintance Carruthers, whose fluent German could prove useful. What he doesn't do, at least at first, is tell Carruthers just what is afoot, suggesting instead a spot of duck hunting and pleasure sailing. What follows soon upon Carruther's arrival is a nautical cat and mouse game involving the small yacht of Davies, an Imperial German gunboat, and an assortment of other yachts and shady characters peopling this melancholy and threatening coastline.I found Childer's work very engaging, especially as I chose to read it while doing some traveling along a similar shoal of islands, though far from Germany and not in a yacht. The novel certainly kept me riveted by its plot, and Childers does a fine job in developing the primary characters and personalities of both Davies and Carruthers who emerge in very human detail against their backdrop. I'm not sure what edition the reader will be reading, but one disapointment I encountered was that the backcover of my edition gave away too much. The nature of the mystery should be left completely to the reader to discover. As some other reviewers have pointed out, the frequent use of nautical terms and the heavy reliance upon the intricacies of coastal features (requiring, at least for the curious, a continuous back-referencing to the series of maps) does hinder the pace a bit, but not to any great degree. What I found particularly interesting about this work was its language. It is a period piece, not just historically, by revealing a growing unease among Britain of the period of a rising German power, but culturally, as seen in the very approach to their problem taken by Davies and Carruthers. It is a game, and the phrase ""playing the game"" comes up frequently in the course of the text. Manliness and ruggedness, being proven and found worthy by one's adversaries (be they the elements or the Germans), and most of all ""winning the game"" with pluck and verve are all salient characteristics of Childer's attitude (and certainly not unique to him). I found the novel revealing in the general attitude towards international rivalry and war in the pre-World War One years. It was this gamesmenship attitude to combat and its challenges (a very British notion) that helped contribute to the willingness with which men threw themselves into death in 1914. I'm not sure if ""Riddle of the Sands"" is indeed the first modern espionage thriller (what about Arthur Conan Doyle?), but it is a perfect insight into period attitudes and fears. It is also exciting reading.",book

1112,"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Good choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.<br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other beautifully. <br /><br />This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever.",movie

Not improbably, this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation and at marriageable period of life, might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan among them all.'In sharp contrast with Puritanism, the ultimate message of the author is crystal clear: 'Be true!

1130,"I saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though I knew it wasn't of award winning caliber...I kinda liked it. It tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson, a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with his mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task, however, is the Grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think Pack 7 is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review, the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor. It doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.",movie

Well once we started, we could not stop!  We went with some oysters on the half shell ($1 oyster happy hour, yea!), steak tartare, deviled eggs three ways, and spaghetti carbonara.

It traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart).<br /><br />Chip was with the FBI from day one, and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world, even occasionally his family. The FBI Story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent, and how being one affects his personal life. The film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the FBI handles and how they handle them. The audience gets to see Chip stop Ku Klux Klan riots, go undercover to solve an Indian murder/estate scandal, bring fugitives into custody, rescue hostages, and helped fight in WWII. He even helped bring Communist spies to justice.<br /><br />Stewart, in a vaguely complex performance, is stellar (as always) as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much. One of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both Chip's family life and his job. We witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son. We also observe his wife having a miscarriage, and his marriage having rocky times. Almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job. Vera Miles gives a spotty performance, but it's very convincing, none the less. She was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her. Well maybe that's just me? Sadly, none of the other performances are worth mentioning, but the attention-grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested.<br /><br />The cinematography of this film was impressive, especially the scenes in the South American jungles. The colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps the greatest part of this movie was Mervyn Leroy's fabulous direction. Every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story. It's chock full of ingenious camera shots, some with a very Hitchcockian feel.<br /><br />All in all, The FBI Story is a spectacular, but overlooked film. Clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated, but if you get the chance I recommend jumping into this one. I enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's spectacular performance, and the captivating story.",movie
1149,"eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the ""real"" one.<br /><br />Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end. I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends that twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of disconcerting.<br /><br />The problem with this film though is its base nature, in a sense. Cronenberg is questioning reality AND criticizing game play. Yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it: the violence, the discontinuity, the lack of focus and in a sense, the pixellation even if there isn't such pixellation in the film. I have once heard someone state that Cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media, but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sludge.<br /><br />What IS brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense, only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice-versa, all of that stuff) along with the motif of penetration. It definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal ""pods"" of biological matter that squirm and shift and are, frankly, disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees. For what it's worth, this film causes a reaction in you.<br /><br />But what for? It criticizes virtual reality, but it's a movie: it is its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design, yet it maintains that banality. It definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet I say again, it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people, objects, beasts, things, and organisms into bloody shreds.<br /><br />So whereas it has a key focus of angst, it doesn't really do anything with it, not really. Only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can't really be denied its own moment of splendor.<br /><br />In a sense, it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent, because there's no good reason I can see for loving it and yet I can't disregard it as mediocre or bad. It'd be easier to simply not be able to take it, but since I can, there's nothing I can really do with it. I do believe it is a little excessive, it really didn't need to go as far as it went, but Cronenberg's intentions are so mixed up and confused I don't know if that was Cronenberg's flaw or Cronenberg's point, and I don't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB",movie
1150,"After huge budget disaster films set in America like The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like Flood.<br /><br />Using mainly unknown actors and actresses and actually focusing on England it was a welcome change of pace to seeing The Empire State Building being demolished.<br /><br />However, this is not a strong film on any basis. Whilst being fairly shocking seeing all your favourite London landmarks being demolished by a very fake CGI storm surge, Flood doesn't really deliver on anything else.<br /><br />The performances are bland, being saved from the pit of hell by David Suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as the Deputy Priminister. He is perhaps a little too calm for what is going on in the film, all that fake water gushing around London must have made him pretty annoyed.<br /><br />It is understandable that the effects weren't going to be as good as TDAT and DI, but the CGI was at best, average.<br /><br />Bland, disappointing and sometimes even tiresome.

I still don't think \pi_1 should have been left out; although one *could* refer to the prequel, there's still more to be desired by way of completeness, if anything, as this book is intended for beginners. For instance, the relation between the fundamental group and the first homology group would have certainly shed some light on these seemingly (at first glance, anyway) disparate invariants (as it is heavy-going on the (co)homological apparatus altogether).Munkres is by no means encyclopaedic, which is good, in opposition to, say, Spanier or Whitehead, and certainly warrants attention to worked-out examples in detail and some (not-so) routine exercises which makes this book accessible to wider mathematical audiences wishing to learn a little about this fascinating subject.",book
1153,"Three cheers for the American Red Cross and its recruitment efforts during the Great War and beyond. Hemingway volunteered and left from New York in May, 1918, to serve as an ambulance driver attached to the Italian army, only to be wounded shortly thereafter on July 8th, as are so many civilians during all wars. During hospital recovery, the young Hemingway became amorously involved with a Red Cross nurse from Philadelphia, Agnes von Kurowsky, the picture of Midwestern wholesomeness, who started rejecting him in 1919 and eventually married someone else she met in Haiti while on Red Cross assignment in 1928.The novel ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1929) is, in part, Hemingway's answer to Agnes. He remakes himself into a soldier in the Allied Italian army, but avoids the class stigma of the enlisted in favor of officer status. Henceforth, protagonist Frederic Henry is simply referred to as ""Tenente,"" or lieutenant, though the anti-war tone of the novel soon has one character ask ""Tenente? Who's a Tenente? A basso gli ufficiali! Down with the officers!"" Henry is, of course, an officer who largely refuses to keep a professional distance from his men, preferring that they see him as a one-of-the-guys friend.To his credit, Hemingway uses the novel to downplay his ""bravery"" medal awarded during his brief exposure to combat conditions. Henry's friend Rinaldi mentions to him that ""they say if you can prove you did any heroic act you can get the silver. Otherwise it will be the bronze. Tell me exactly what happened. Did you do any heroic act?"" Henry's answer is consistent: ""No,"" I said. ""I was blown up while we were eating cheese."" Hemingway's intention is, of course, to debunk all forms of bravery, spirituality, and patriotism: ""I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice...I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory...""So what does Frederic Henry believe in? Spirits. Well, on just about every page he believes that he should seek out alcohol so that it's embedded into every facet of his life (too bad for later college freshmen who were force-fed this novel). As a movement incubator, Hemingway certainly qualifies as a drug-oriented forerunner of both punk and Gonzo, if not the father of. After all, Prohibition was well underway in America when the novel was being written. Always good to take sides in a controversy. Did Hemingway become an ex-patriot so that he could drink himself freely into oblivion, a slow march toward his eventual suicide?At one point, during what appears to be a cowardly mass retreat, Henry and other officers are held accountable by military officials who seek to re-establish discipline and patriotism. The ""battle police"" asked questions like ""Why are you not with your regiment?"" and ""Do you not know that an officer should be with his troops?"" One officer flatly laid it out to the miscreants: ""It is you and such as you that have let the barbarians onto the sacred soil of the fatherland...Italy should never retreat."" Of course, all of this means little to Henry who is neither Italian, nor an advocate of higher values of any kind.Hemingway's style in the novel is to be commended, however, because it attempts to simulate the adumbrated, laconic rhythms of everyday speech, much applauded by foreigners reading English for the first time. He's the master of adolescent letter beginnings such as ""How are you. I'm fine. Hope you're fine too."" Yes, the common man triumphant in the Hollywood era of the strong, silent type. Seems to work well with those in an alcoholic stupor, putting one foot (or word, in this case) in front of another. Capably mirroring those in the field, Frederic Henry is bereft of the big picture and historical context.",book

1157,"I loved the book and found it very inspirational. The way it starts off in the present, and then goes back into time and leads up to the future in the form of story was creative and helped the mystery of the book. Sparks shows Noah's passion and love for Allie by letting us know everything though Noah is feeling or thinking. It makes one feel like they are there actually witnessing the love story and feeling what Noah and Allie are. Once you start the book, you can't put it down. It's addicting! It makes you want to know what is really going to happen between Allie and Noah. You just want them to be together so bad that you keep telling Allie to tell Noah that she still loves him.The first two quarters lead you up to the climax of Noah and Allie making love. You can actually feel what they are feeling because they pour their hearts out to one another and release all the feelings they have been building up in the first half of the book. It is such a passionate scene, that it makes you step back and wonder how to people can be so profoundly in love after so many years. You get all happy because you think they will be the perfect couple for forever, and then the story takes you for another surprise.This book is just so powerful and heart wrenching, that you can not help but love it. There is never a dull moment; it's full of passion, heart ache, depression and love. All these combined make the book mysterious and great. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves love stories because this is one of the all time greatest love stories.This is the second Nicholas Sparks book I have read and it won't be the last.

1159,"The first Matrix movie was lush with incredible character development, witty dialog, and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story. These elements -- coupled by incredible special effects of the day -- presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time. Enter Matrix Reloaded (and its sequel, Revolutions). The problem here isn't the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue; The brothers have taken well-developed characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs.¬Ö The connection that was first established between viewers and on-screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first Matrix movie.<br /><br />To wit, Morpheus was developed as a charismatic, philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie, but here in Reloaded -- we're presented by a different Morpheus who stands hard and hollow, reduced to corny one-liners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film. This character just didn't feel the same, and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie.<br /><br />The removal of 'Tank' was also a disappointment. Tank's involvement in the first film was minimal at best, but he played the role extremely well. In Reloaded, we discover that Tank dies after the events in the first film, and he is replaced by a Jar Jar Binks stunt double that couldn't act to save his live (think stale box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes). His performance left me chuckling throughout, and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing. There was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions on-screen or the delivery in the script was off; in either case, the experience was humorous! At times I felt embarrassed for the actor....<br /><br />Even Neo's Godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences. The alleyway battle with the 200 Agent Smith clones was certainly exaggerated. One must wonder, for a man so gifted as Neo -- that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless, frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend (especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the Matrix; certainly Neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker, and more efficiently). Again, such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency, and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped. In jest, our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly. Sadly, for those expecting more of the same -- you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointed.<br /><br />However, if you take Reloaded as your standard, run-of-the-mill action movie, and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of already-established character development from the first film, you should walk away feeling quite pleased.",movie

Now, Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do that, they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money.<br /><br />The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this film.<br /><br />There are some confusing moments in this film. But that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway, this movie is only made for harmless fun.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great heist movie.

They have an all glass peaked roof which makes the space feel very open & spacious & you're not stick in some claustrophobic mall.  Another section has an all glass Dome Ceiling. 
I love their all glass walkway bridge that keeps you safe from inclement weather. You can walk while looking down at the traffic & city below.

You can purchase tickets here to see the SkyWalk Observation Deck which is located on the 50rh Floor of this iconic building nicknamed The Pru. The Observation Deck gives you a  great panoramic view of the entire city of Boston & it's surrounding towns. 
INSIDE MONEY SAVINGS TIP 1) You can Save some money here by stopping by the Concierge Desk & picking up a FREE PRUferred Shopping Card. You will get some Discounts & Deals at numerous shops. 
INSIDE MONEY SAVINGS TIP 2) if you visit here on Sundays you can park for FREE on the surrounding streets at the meters if you happen to snag a Free space. Otherwise they have a Paid Parking structure in the complex. Expect to pay high parking rates as you are in Downtown Boston. Also if you visit Establishments like Eataly Restaurant in the Pru; they have validated Parking.

Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. If done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to not waste your time on The '60s and do something else with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class, and not on my own time.

This time, after loosing her husband and her studio, Lucky sets out to rebuilt her life and regain her statut as Lady Boss.Bringing back characters from her previous novels, and introducing us to new ones, Collins not only succeeds in penning another blockbuster, but also re-establishes herself as the queen of popular fiction. VENDETTA : Lucky's Revenge is Collins at her best. Well crafted, suspensful, steamy, it keeps the reader glued to the pages and makes you wish Collins would write a fifth book about the Santangelo clan, which, by the way, is exactly what she's doing.",book
1185,"A warmly sentimental tale from the author of The Waltons. Were someone to pitch the material to me, I would probably reject it as too maudlin. But the dramatization here manages a tear without the expected embarrassment. No one in the 1950's was better at lovable hayseeds than Arthur Hunnicutt. His appeal here is put to consummate use as a mountain man doggedly faithful to a loyal hunting hound. Their fates are tied together as inseparably as any human bond. Good. I see a subtle environmental message here. All critters go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor devil that merely follows instinct in order to stay alive. There is no deceit in the kingdom of animals, and yet how cruelly we often treat them. An oddly satisfying episode that confirms this important message.",movie
1186,"I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which isn't much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a double feature with that movie. I really didn't know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you tell from the trailer? Well, apparently I could tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sens to me. The special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in God's name is going on. I understand Mark HIcks had a extremely low budget, but come on. And it is sad, because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see. But sadly, watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone's life. It is so utterly painful to sit through. I really can't even explain the plot to you because I didn't understand it at all and I have sadly seen this film two times! Apparently they used some type of puppets for the ""alien dinosaurs"" like they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are awful, I can't stress it enough. And most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly. It takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around, and they look like they are in the kkk. And some box with a blue light on it is the president. I know in the interview Mark Hicks said something about making this a television pilot, well, I can see why this didn't make it to CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this film. 1. the music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman's introduction is as always hilarious. Overall, don't waste your time but check out Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!",movie

1188,"I never was an avid viewer of ""Crocodile Hunter"", but did occasionally see an episode, or a bit of an episode, and when the news spread about Steve Irwin's death from a stingray attack in 2006, it certainly caught my attention. This movie, with Steve and his wife, Terri, playing themselves, but in a fictional story, was released in 2002, but I didn't hear of it until several years later, and even after that, it took me a while to get around to seeing it. Well, now I have seen it, and after looking here first (more than once), and seeing its rating, I was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be, though it could have been a BIT better. Apparently, it's supposed to be a comedy, so a major problem with it is that it isn't very funny at all.<br /><br />A U.S. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in Australia, where it is swallowed by a crocodile! While Steve and Terri Irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy Brozzie Drewitt, and are unaware of what's inside it, two CIA agents are sent to Australia to retrieve the beacon! The agents are assisted by Jo Buckley, and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them! On Steve and Terri's mission, they face other types of dangerous wildlife, not just the crocodile, and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it, when Steve sees the CIA agents after them, he mistakes them for poachers! <br /><br />Not only did I not laugh once while watching this film, the only part that really made me smile was Steve Irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the CIA agents. Apart from that, I don't think I found anything even mildly amusing. It's also a bit of an incoherent mess, switching back and forth from the Australian Outback to the CIA headquarters, and it seems like clips from ""Crocodile Hunter"" and clips from an action thriller (or something like that) put together for some reason. Also added to that mix are the ranch scenes, which also seem to be from somewhere else, and as funny as Brozzie Drewitt, played by Magda Szubanski, is supposed to be, she's not. At one point, we see her farting, so we have a fart joke, a MAJOR clich√© in modern comedy! Are they SO hard to resist?! I also found the typical ""Crocodile Hunter"" scenes, with Steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers, to be tedious, but I guess the fact that I was never a devout fan of the show didn't help.<br /><br />Steve Irwin was admired by many as a conservationist, and is sadly missed by them, while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him. No matter which side you're on, ""The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course"" is not a well crafted movie. I'm sure it does help if you're a big Steve Irwin fan, but even if you are, there's no guarantee that you would like this movie, as some fans clearly haven't been impressed. In fact, it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than I have, so maybe it WON'T help. Like I said, there's no guarantee. I would say whatever you may think of Steve Irwin and his show, this movie was unnecessary. The attempt to combine what is usually seen in ""Crocodile Hunter"" with a fictional story unfortunately failed, and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes!",movie

Unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting. Though I liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy (i.e. Towards the end when Ray Mitchell hits a homer he doesn't step on the plate and therefore that wouldn't be a score. But that's just nitpicking.) I have to say i was really impressed with this movie's presence and moral: Just have faith, Don't give up.",movie
1191,"I wanted vegetables, but convenience won out.

Fuku is just around the corner from the Snowport Winter Village, and they were still open as we wandered west, back towards Boston city proper.

I yelped them to realize that their more popular sandwich seemed to be of a spicy fried chicken variety.  Unfortunately, I am a self proclaimed spice wimp.  Nontheless, in consideration of my companion's time constraints and physical weariness, I decided to walk in to check out the menu.

For a later mealtime, we were the line, although there were two parties already served in the limited dining area.  This allowed me to guiltlessly hog the full attention of the friendly and helpful staff, as I asked my questions and mulled over my possibilities.

They thoughtfully informed me that the Vada Pav $4.50 (crispy potato cake, fried garlic, pickle, scallion sauce, martin's potato roll) alone would take 8 minutes to make.  It was a handful for sure, and hot and crispy, with a kick too, it turns out.  So be warned, not everything on the menu that is spicy hot is marked as such.  For instance, the sauce in the Macaroni Salad $3.50 (carrot, shishito, fuku mayo) is kicked up, and all their dipping sauces have some spiciness added to them (Ssam Sauce, Knockout Sauce, Ranch, Honey Mustard, Fuko Mayo).  Their pickles are made hot too.

But fortunately, the battering for their Chicken Bites $4.50 (dark meat) is not kicked up, so I had the chance to sample Fuku's chicken, and it was good.  Moist dark meat surrounded by a crisp crust.  Perhaps the most generously sized of the items I tried.

At the other end of the portion spectrum was the scoop of Macaroni Salad with its overcooked elbow pasta.  The sauce was nice on it though.  I let the staff know so hopefully they'll take my comment into consideration.  I also voiced a wish for more non-spicy options, but that's in David Chang's hands.

Also a bit tiny, but really tasty, was their dollar Cheesey Bread (King's hawaiian roll, fuku mayo, cheese).  Perhaps the size of a third of a hot dog roll?",restaurant

1193,"Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. I'm not very fond of them myself, but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of British horror cinema. The House That Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus, featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a Scotland Yard officer by an estate agent.<br /><br />This film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, whom horror fans will recognise as one of Lee's co-stars in the greatest British horror film of all time; The Wicker Man.<br /><br />The first segment of the film, titled ""Method For Murder"" tells the story of a horror storywriter, whose creation; a strangler named ""Dominic"" is brought to life by his own imagination. This story builds suspense very well; through his girlfriend, he, and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination. This story certainly isn't very original, but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist; which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise.<br /><br />The second story, titled ""Waxworks"", stars Peter Cushing and is my least favourite of the four. This tale follows the story of Phillip Grayson (Cushing), a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in. Inside, he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess. Quite what the woman's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details. Cushing is later joined by his friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Ackland) and that's when the tale really starts to pick up. The setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isn't a new idea; the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent 1966 horror film, ""Chamber of Horrors"". Although the one here isn't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film, the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect, much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia, brought about by the limited area of the museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch, and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan. Despite being my least favourite, this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down.<br /><br />The film continues with ""Sweets for the Sweet"", which is without doubt the best of the omnibus. This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out. It leaves the audience guessing; we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter, but we don't know who, or what, it is. Christopher Lee, as usual, portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness; the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll, and the fact that she isn't allowed to go to school or have any toys. The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end, epitomised by the truly chilling line in which Lee tells his babysitter that he is, in fact, afraid of his daughter. The ending to this section is superbly played out, in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told, and will stay with you long after the end credits roll.<br /><br />The omnibus finishes with ""The Cloak"", which is definitely the most comedic of the four. This tale is about a hammy horror film star that, unimpressed by his latest film's technical side, goes out and buys himself a cloak. Naturally, this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak. Unlike the other three tales, this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs. That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. The ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film, which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film. Also, look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula. A nice touch, I think.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a horror omnibus, you really cant go wrong with The House that Dripped Blood. The third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed.",movie
1194,"Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about him doing a kids film, because I would hate to see him depart from his films I came to love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi the killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Lately he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he's succeeding. Still this was the first of his films I'd seen him take that direction, so I was nervous. Of coarse I bought it without seeing it and was glad I did.<br /><br />Great Yokai War is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too. The whole film reminded me so much of the movies I loved as a child: Neverending story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either. The dark underlying morals are there, but, it's also as silly as any kids film should be. I personally wasn't bothered by the CGI and prosthetics. I feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice.<br /><br />If you are a die hard Takashi Miike fan, you may not like this one. But, I suggest giving it a shot. It proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspected he is. He also continues to make his signature Miike films outside of these ones, which is very reassuring.<br /><br />To those people that are new to Takashi Miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one, I suggest these other Miike films: 'Zebraman' 'The Happiness of the Katakuris' 'Sabu' and 'The Bird People in China.' <br /><br />Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.",movie

1196,"The premise of this story is very simple. A man named Robert Neville is the last man alive on Earth. Everyone else have become vampires and this story is about Robert's life being alone in a world full of hideous beings. It is a very simple and basic premise and yet Richard Matheson has taken it and spun a really deep and complex tale out of it.All throughout the book, there are instances where we truly feel for Robert, the pain and frustration he goes through on a daily basis. He struggles with the isolation of being alone, the defeat of not able to find a cure for vampirism, the mysteries surrounding vampirism, and ultimately the seeming 'betrayal' of a woman named Ruth, the only living being he knows after the plaque. Mr. Matheson describes all of this in beautiful, beautiful prose. Not only that, he also has a knack for creating believable characters; all of these characters, even his animal ones, behave the way they should, and it is a delight to read about them.There were some highly technical parts of the book which I felt dragged the pace down, but not too badly as to make the book feel too long-winded. For the most part, the story chugs along nicely.One more thing I've noticed about I AM LEGEND was that it felt very allegorical of the problems we have in our world today. Man is a very territorial and violent species and we see that even in a post-apocalytic context, wars and conflicts of interest can still happen, and will happen.I am Legend is truly a triumph of story telling, Mr. Matheson was clearly at the top of his game when he wrote it.",book

There were so many elements to this story that were not explained, or were forced into place with out any real thought. elements like the love story could have been expanded on a bit more, and the cannons need to be written in better. the whole main character growing up thing needed more about the training he was receiving and less standing around. everyone likes a good ""little guy overcomes"" story and this showed promise but with the scripting failures wasn't to be.

If you don't want to read this kind of review, then go.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, you're hearing this from a man who laughed through Titanic and almost broke his parents' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene.<br /><br />---Spoilers---<br /><br />One day, I went off to the theatres with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, last year in August. The boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly. It was for Radio. The moment I saw the trailer, I just had to see this movie on opening weekend. When that weekend rolled along, Scary Movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that Friday night. It turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie, they went and also sold out Good Boy and Radio. I couldn't get a ticket and the following weeks, I was busy with more important things. About 5 months later, my friend rented Radio. He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room. I'll tell you this now, this is the ONLY movie I have ever seen that got me crying EVER. When Radio's mother died, it just came out automatically. The next day, I went off to Blockbuster and bought the DVD.<br /><br />Well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nick-named Radio. Ed Harris co-stars and this movie is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story, Radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone. He goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around. He's got his own collection. At the end of every day, he goes home to his mother. He never went to school until later in the film. One day, Radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing. A football flies over the fence and Radio picks it up and continues on. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, the football coach. They meet and this is the life of Radio.<br /><br />Throughout the whole movie, Radio and Coach Jones spend quality time together, both teaching each other things. It is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys, the lowest lows, and just seeing Radio live his life. You will laugh, cry, and live the life of Radio with him. This movie holds a special place in my heart along with Toy Story and others. This is a must-see for the whole family, by yourself, or if you're someone who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Radio will never be forgotten by me. Never.<br /><br />As Ed Harris' character said greatly near the end of the movie:<br /><br />""We're not teaching Radio, Radio is teaching us.""<br /><br />My Rating: 8/10<br /><br />Eliason A.",movie

It reminded me a tad of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has that strange madness in it, but I was glued to the movie for other reasons - namely that it presents a portrait of Australia which is..well, very believable.<br /><br />I have vacationed to the Land Down Under a number of times, once in the 1980's and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /><br />I don't wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations, but the director Frayne appears to have a grasp on much that I find so odd and eccentric about Australia, a country that is responsible for the extremities of, say, Nick Cave on one hand, and Steve Irwin (the 'Crocodile Hunter') on the other.<br /><br />One incy wincy whinge - - I would have preferred even more of the 'unknown' Australia.

1213,"I've now re-read the entire Wheel of Time(WoT) series several times. This book is, in my opinion, the best of the ones he has written so far(through Crown of Swords). Jordan, as always, does a fantastic job of building up to events, and making you suspect how they will turn out... and then coming up with something completely different. His descriptions are phenominal. There are several parts of the series that, quite litterally, bring me to tears, not only once, but every time I re-read it. This is the only series that gets the reader that involved. For those who have not re-read the series, it is _well_ worth it. There are so many clues and hints of what is to come that you never pick up on the first time through. Small details, nasty and intricate plot turns that get skipped on the first read. I've bought the entire series in hard-cover because my paperback editions were, quite litterally, falling appart. The first 25+ pages of The Shadow Rising are now somewhere unknown, as they have fallen out. While it was all but impossible to put these books down when I first read them, by now that compulsion is gone since, obviously, I know what is to happen. However, I find the books even more emotionally gripping as I read through them again and again. There are some parts that, after reading them, you need to take a long pause, and run through it again in your mind. A fabulous writer. An incredible series. If you have never liked Fantasy, this is the book to start with. If you already enjoy Fantasy, there is so much that is new an original that you will constantly be surprised. In a final note, if you like Jordan, try Terry Goodkind's the Sword of Truth series... It's not as good as Jordan, but closer than anything else I have read.",book

1215,"The good news: the director is reportedly committed to the cause of Amnesty International and eager to deliver a solid message about the freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. The plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites. The not-so-good news: 'original' is not everybody's buzzword when visiting the movies or video stores. Also, noted critics like Mr Maltin and Roger Ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to convert a play from stage into cinematic form. If I remember correctly, the title is taken from the fairy tale Stowe's character has written and which has made her a possible subversive and suspect person in the fictitious place where the story takes place. Her dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by Rickman as the intense, manipulative interrogator. Since those two people are virtually the only ones appearing in the film altogether, the director is in for a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention. In the end, I found the whole thing fascinating. Not flawless and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. It's nowhere near a masterpiece like Kieslowski's 'A short film about killing' or as explanatory as 'Dead man walking'. But if you're into those films or any of Costa-Gavras political thrillers, you may appreciate this one as well. Just don't expect any overexplicit sermons or eyefilling action sequences.",movie

If you can read this book from cover to cover without looking up a single word in dictionary, you will do quite well on the verbal part of the SAT.By the way, story is pretty good too. Not the Hollywood version of ""I have created a monster"" thrill-ride but a close examination of how we ambitious humans tend to screw things up and in trying to fix it, we screw it up even more.Monster in the book is very eloquent and I got a big kick out of that.",book

We ordered an assortment of items from the menu to give us an overall idea of the food and we just damn hungry . The boiled food was very flavorful and not too salty, like most of the seafood boil restaurants sauces. The 145 sauce here was a thin sauce, but full of chopped garlic, spices, and flavor. The food is served in plastic bags , which works perfectly for takeout. The headless and deveined shrimp were cooked perfectly and plump. The snow crab was also good. Along with the boiled shrimp and snow crab, we had fried shrimp and wings. The shrimp were perfectly seasoned and crunchy. The wings were a breaded lemon pepper dry seasoned treat. I prefer a wet sauce on wings, this was good. Overall, I would return. I hope they try to create a lemon pepper sauce for the boil items. Oh, the sausage was very salty.",restaurant
1219,"It's is amazing how children learn. Others speak to your children in one breath exactly what you have shared with them for years and the children can not repeat a single word you have spoke while they can recall with perfect clarity the words of others with the exact same teachings.Our family has taken turns reading JR's book at dinner time and it quickly and easily unlocked conversations that were previously difficult to convey without our children's eyes glazing over. Our 3 kids (15-B, 12-G & 12-B), have all commented about the valuable teachings found within each chapter. Our communication with each other has grown and improved and the attitudes toward one another are more positive and helpful. If you are raising children do yourself a favor and read the first chapter or two together and I know for a fact you will love the feedback from your kids and your spouse.I believe JR's book will be just like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" where it took time before everyone reviewed the subject matter for themselves and determined how great the story is to the viewer. Thanks JR for your wonderful words and taking the time to place them in a book for all of us to enjoy.Mark",book
1220,"I don't know why, but i thought i've seen this movie before. Maybe it was the name, maybe it was the way poster looked, i don't know. Anyway, it was quite promising in the beginning. And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments. Maybe its because i'm not a huge fan of the horrors, and i don't watch them a lot, but this one actually looked fresh sometimes. But the rest of it is not so good. Laughable at times. The movie is slow paced, sometimes you will get so bored you'd forget what was the story about. Characters are not great either. All of them. The butcher is OK, seems creepy and crazy enough. Although i didn't get what were those weird looking things on his chest (that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out-of-the-blue), and why he was collecting those in jars at home? The main lead is plain. His character is really hard to believe in, and very undeveloped. But i guess thats scenarists fault. Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend? Side cast is bad too. But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl. My god, when will women in horror movies have any brains? Its ridiculous. The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera, tries going to police, that fails, and then she thinks of the best idea ever. Why don't we just go and take it! I know where the maniac lives! Yup! Thats swell! And then look for the camera in the bathroom! Why not? And then walk in the room, see a bag that was not there before, and just have a look inside. Maybe camera is there? Not there. But loads of interesting stuff. Shiny. Mmmm. To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain. Then of course the never ending ""falling while running away"" trick, that really made it look bad. Then, to put the final nail into the character, in the end of the movie, she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up, screams ""Noooo"" like she just ripped her Gucci bag, and walks further into the wagon... Jeez. Come on. No one else thinks its just, well, stupid? Just awful. If her character wasn't so bad, maybe the movie would get another star or two from me. And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer (that dude in the train who the conductor killed), butcher vests that can protect from bullets, weird and cheap looking monsters in the end (i didn't read Clive Barkers novel, so i have no idea where those monsters came from), the fact that no one cared that hundreds (judging on the skeletons in the dungeon) disappeared in the city, and main character that didn't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out (he barely noticed it i guess). Oh, and the predictable ending. Damn, i knew the ending half way in, its just disappointing. The only reason i'm still giving some credit to the makers, is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i've watched past few months. Visual style is nice, some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal. (although blood didn't look real at all) I guess some people will enjoy it, some, like me, will watch it if there is nothing else to watch, some will absolutely hate it.",movie
1221,"After first reading The Fountainhead I dove head long into Atlas hoping for a similar experience, but about a third of the way into the book it began to drag and I had to take a break because it was just so slow. I kept thinking about the book and after about a six month break picked it up again and started fresh. Think of this book as a nice long TV series as apposed to just a few episodes. The story is well written, if all be it a little sluggish at times, and the characters engaging. Rand's ideas will get you to think and think a lot. It's almost more relevant today then when it first came out. I was shocked when I was reading the book because things happening in it are happening in real life. It's a book that made me angry at things going on around me and think about how we got to where we are. Not a fast read, and Rand tends to make a point that could have been told in a paragraph or two go on for a page or two, but that's a minor complaint compared to the eye opening experience reading this book was. I do think one should start out with The Fountainhead to get used to her style but then by all means read this.",book

1225,"""Fever Pitch"" is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother (though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes).<br /><br />I have lived through a milder version of such a story, as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the Mets first World Series win and then I watched the Mets clinch their next one because I was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons, who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood National League team's other heartbreaking failures to win it again (and it was me who took our older son to his only Fenway Park game as I caught a bit of Red Sox fever as a graduate student in Boston).<br /><br />So compared to reality, the script believably creates two people with actual jobs. It is particularly impressive that Drew Barrymore's character is a substantive workaholic who has anti-Barbie skills, though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work.<br /><br />It is even set up credibly how she meets Jimmy Fallon's math teacher and how she falls for his ""winter guy"" -- though it's surprising that his Red Sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off to his Jekyll-and-Hyde ""summer guy."" Their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown-up way, from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him, centered around that they are both facing thirty and single. Fallon surprisingly rises to his character's gradual emotional maturity.<br /><br />While the ending borrows heavily from O. Henry, the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the Sox's incredible 2004 season into a revised story line (with lots of cooperation from the Red Sox organization for filming at the stadium).<br /><br />The script goes out of its way to explain why Fallon doesn't have a Boston accent, as an immigrant from New Jersey, but that doesn't explain why his motley friends don't. The most authentic sounding Boston sounds come from most of his ""summer family"" of other season ticket holders, who kindly kibitz the basics of Sox lore to neophyte Barrymore (and any such audience members).<br /><br />The song selection includes many Red Sox fans' favorites, from the opening notes of the classic ""Dirty Water,"" though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear.",movie

1227,"This trashy B movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction, but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick. The story revolves around Sammy Horn (subtle name) played by Michael Des Barres. Sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife Grace (Rosanna Arquette) and a young child. He has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree (and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting Social Security).<br /><br />The story is centered on a conversation with his therapist (Nastassja Kinski) where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback. This is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts, which consumes at least 75% of the screen time.<br /><br />It is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad. The production values are abysmal. The movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a TV soap opera (at best) and an amateur porn flick shot in someone's garage. The direction by Joseph Brutsman is horrible with bad lighting, uninspired framing and poor actor direction. The script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar.<br /><br />Women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like Sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation. As an example, Grace's sister comes over to indignantly inform Sammy that she knows he's been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife. His response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her. About three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more. Just as they finish Grace walks in and sis says to her, `Oh, great to see you, gotta run to pick up Timmy' and mum's the word about Sammy's indiscretions. The bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment. No spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it.<br /><br />The sex depictions are all overdone, mechanical, and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic. Most of them are done with both participants fully clothed. The acting is wretched. Michael Des Barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle. He really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts, but when it comes to actually acting with Arquette and Kinski, he is adrift. Rosanna Arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film, giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal. Nastassja Kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist, but at least we have some acting happening here. The rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like `hit me harder, is that the best you can do?' and `Oh, God¬ÖYES'.<br /><br />This movie is among the worst I have ever seen, a dubious distinction given the thousands of films I have viewed. I have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1/10. Not to be seen within three hours of any meal.",movie

Green Monster Roll: 3/5 we much prefered the simpler, cheaper spicy salmon roll to this.  There is too much going on in the sushi and it was too sweet.  We ended up brushing off the seaweed on top and some other items in it and it tasted a bit better.

1234,"It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for ""The Sopranos,"" as its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all. Everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time Blank got to the reunion I had stopped caring. Frankly, I found this movie a drag from start to finish.<br /><br />It had potential. There was a reasonably good cast, headed by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, playing Grocer, his arch-rival in the hit-man business, along with Minnie Driver as Debi, Blank's high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night, and a limited role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist. That fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together, though. The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour. What I thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was Grocer's proposal for a hit man's union, but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke, the idea never really got developed. As for the romance, one wondered why Debi would even think of letting this guy back into her life.<br /><br />There were a handful of chuckles, but nothing really caught me and held me and I spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click. It never did - not for me, at least. 2/10",movie

He too goes over saftey in the next Chapter. He then talks about the different farm welding processes such as oxyacetylene, arc (stick) and MIG (wire fed). Finch also covers how to identify metals on and around the farm. Chapter 5 covers oxyacetylene cutting, heating and plasma cutting. From there on, he pretty much goes into all of the processes I prevously mentioned only in much greater detail. He also concentrates on some ""hard to weld"" metals such a cast iron and aluminum.

1242,"During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: 'The Evil That Men Do,' a TriStar Films pickup from Sir Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment firm. Bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, which ran through numerous actioners until 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' in 1989.<br /><br />Expectations should run pretty high with Bronson and Thompson working for a better-funded outfit like ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a great disappointment on many levels. While still from the low budget, B-movie mold of the 1980s, 'Evil' has tantalizing potential for a great film. Everyone in the production department, however, took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of Bronson's imprint. 'The Evil That Men Do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of Bronson and Thompson's best films, but instead will go down as one of their most average.<br /><br />This 1984 political thriller/actioner opens in brutal fashion with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British doctor, holding his special training class for political leaders in Surinam. The gray-haired, passive Molloch is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes. In the opening seven minutes, we witness Molloch using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As you may expect, the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original VHS release.<br /><br />Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the Cayman Islands. Holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of Molloch, but turned the offer down. A Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (Jos√© Ferrer) visits shortly after Hidalgo's death to talk Holland into finishing the job, bringing videotapes of testimony from The Doctor's victims. While in denial at first, Holland eventually agrees to the dirty work, targeting Molloch and his doting sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala.<br /><br />Holland enters Guatemala City with help from an adviser, Max Ortiz (Ren√© Enr√≠quez); he poses as a tourist with Hidalgo's widow Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas) in tow. As with most of Bronson's later output, his character knocks off Molloch's henchmen one by one, crossing paths with a sleazy American diplomat (John Glover) and his supporting hit-man (Roger Cudney) along the way. A brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal mine, where The Doctor gets just deserts from several of his victims.<br /><br />'The Evil That Men Do' is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps at American political dealings in Latin America during the 1980s. Indeed, 'Evil' is hard-boiled in every sense of the term, as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development. For every plus this film has, there are three or four minuses, resulting from shod craftsmanship.<br /><br />While 'The Evil That Men Do' has a great concept, the film is never truly more than an excuse for Bronson to wipe out foreign-based scum. In the style of bad pulp fiction, 'Evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand. Holland, despite being played strongly by Bronson, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire. Rhiana, a terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana, is disgusted by Holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him. Where does her love come from, especially after watching Holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before?<br /><br />The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because so many questions can be asked of them. Naturally, we never find out what has brought them so close together, how and where their torture dealings started, what Claire's exact role in their business is¬ÖThese plot holes can go on forever, especially with the paint-by-numbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along. Why is Hidalgo's daughter brought into such a dangerous situation, other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by Molloch? If Molloch's bodyguard Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) clearly saw Holland and Rhiana in the cockfight arena, why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords? Is his memory that short? And what really was the purpose, other than cheap theatrics, of Holland throwing Molloch's chauffeur Cillero (Jorge Luke) off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in Claire's apartment?<br /><br />The overall acting is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his strongest performances. J. Lee Thompson's direction is lacking at points, but may have been compromised by limited time on site. Besides Evil's filming in Mexico, the presence of ITC is clear through better production values, cinematography, and music. Rural locations are well-used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of Latin America and cinematographer Xavier Cruz provides rich color and clarity. The orchestral score by Ken Thorne ('Murphy's War') is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk. Oddly enough, these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out. Peter Lee Thompson's editing is better than usual, although with more laughable continuity errors.<br /><br />'The Evil Than Men Do' was perfect grindhouse material for the early 80s and I find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans. The DVD from Columbia TriStar Entertainment is an okay presentation, offering widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles. While the video quality is well above average, 'Evil' was originally recorded in plain mono audio. The theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel, with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality.<br /><br />** out of 4",movie

I have had this pizza/location a few times and I would go back and buy pizza again one of the areas, and the only pizzas that I would eat and go to good pizza and the crust is spot on.

1254,"I was just browsing through the customer reviews of this book, and although I'm sure no one gives a damn about what I have to say (in the rare case that anyone will ever even read this review), I would like to offer my opinions and arguments with those who dislike this book. First of all, the issue of teenage angst is a difficult one to depict in words. It is a difficult one to depict without actually being a teen. Most of the depictions of teenage life these days are rather exploitative. They mostly tell teens how to behave and do not show the true side of adolescence. To those readers who complain that Holden is an &quot;immature malcontent&quot; and so on, teenagers are often immature and often are malcontents. If Salinger led you to believe that Holden is an immature malcontent, then his mission was accomplished. At the current age of 17, I can relate to Holden's character moreso than any other teenager depicted in the media. Although Salinger's style of writing is a little too elementary to be called a &quot;classic,&quot; I feel that Holden Caulfield should be the model for teens. Here we have a character who hates change and wants to be a &quot;catcher in the rye.&quot; When I see children shooting each other, I feel that this is a noble goal for anyone to have. While you are entitled to your opinion, keep in mind that if the world were full of Holden's &quot;phonies&quot; it would be a conformist nightmare. Thank god for people like Holden.",book
1255,"Bosnia has pretty much faded into the background of American concern. When the American Division of the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) rolled in on December 1995, the spotlight was on Bosnia and Americans became aware of the military role that their forces would play in the Balkans. Out of the tragedy and confusion of war came a book entitled &quot;Cry Bosnia&quot; by Paul Harris which chronicled the war in Bosnia itself through words and pictures.Inspired by the success of Cry Bosnia, Ruppert Murray decided to write a similar book which would focus on the peacekeepers themselves rather than the political elements of Bosnia. His idea was merely to write minimal text with pictures but as he began to interview the soldiers and have them share their opinions, backgrounds and experiences the book began to take a life of its own. IFOR on IFOR is the soldiers' stories of their perceptions of why and how they came to Bosnia and what they feel their presence will accomplish.The book is divided into three sectors representing the United States of America Division, the British Division and the French Division. He interviews the men and women of the armed forces who candidly share their views with him. Listen to these young warriors as they share their apathy, hope, and naivite in sharing their views of their deployment. The voices are diverse within each division and you can see the differences of opinions that run from nation to nation. The insights you get are extraordinary.On a personal note, I was deployed to Bosnia and stayed there for a year. Everything that you have read, heard and seen in these interviews are what I experienced with this group of international soldiers. I highly recommend this book to you in getting the story of the soldier. Six copies returned home with me and many more were purchased for friends and relatives. This is an excellent chronicle in pictures and words.",book

1257,"All the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced. That is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie. But a movie is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed is given the last world in every single subject. The director herself admitted to this at the first San Francisco film festival showing. She justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to Fujimori. That might be true but by showing so much of Fujimori's take on the issues makes the movie clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced. I dare any of the other commentators to prove this wrong Tips 1: claiming Harvard professors, intellectuals, and Latin American Diplomats agree with you does not help your argument (use logic). Tip 2: disagreeing with the director doesn't help your argument either (The director says she thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and therefore she portrayed him that way)",movie

1259,"As a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, here we come Amelio, again, taking on the task to render us the grey area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. Eroded by globalization's collateral damages, the pessimistic vision of Europe is mutual with Chinas. <br /><br />The view of that charming but puzzling country is dealt from below, devoid of any claim to learn or impose opinions. Reality, nonetheless, is harsh. Abandoned and exploited children, beehive-homes, backward areas is the OTHER china we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a technician of a steel factory, is one of us. His voyage to China is a pretext to understand, to learn from the inside a country where progress and third-world problems live together in an infamous balance. It's not exactly clear if Vincenzo knew by the first time that the mechanical component was already been fixed, I think so; anyway is a minor aspect. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key of the whole film. She carries on her back a lot of difficulties, she's got the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with little money and little help ? <br /><br />The realistic and unbiased view of the facts by the girl, refusing Vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. A pack of bank-notes can't get back her husband, her baby (forced to treat like a stranger for the Law), protect her by scorns. Liu knew his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold charity act. Their friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. A priceless legacy to keep.<br /><br />Some scenes are stunning, either for the acting (Vincenzo crying on the ferry) or by the dialogues (at the restaurant, on the railroads). Besides a careless editing and a pretty lazy start, ""La Stella che non c'√®"" is brilliant and sharp just because chronicles the untold verities.<br /><br />In competition at 63rd Venice Film Festival, plenty bet on Tai Ling for the Mastroianni Prize, dedicated to emerging stars. She definitely deserved that award.<br /><br />[8/10]",movie

1265,"If there's one genre that I've never been a fan of, it's the biopic. Always misleading, filled with false information, over-dramatized scenes, and trickery all around, biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. Skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and moviegoers objected to Gretchen Mol given the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part. I never doubted Mol could handle the part since, but I never expected to as blown as away by her performance as I was upon just viewing the film hours ago. Mol delivers a knockout Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin-up girl, who, after an early life of abuse (depicted subtlety and tastefully done, something few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time. The picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story. Director/co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending. Still, credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully. Come Oscar time, Mol, Turner, and Harron should be receiving nominations. Doubt it will happen, though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them. 9/10",movie

1270,"Thomas Friedman has a good, well researched view of the mentality problems in the Middle East. His views are worthy of attention. His columns present valid points on where Muslim need change in order to have a better understanding of the world they live in. His interviews and conversations with people all over the Muslim world, in turn, give Americans good insight and understanding of the complexity behind the perception of 9/11 and its aftermath through Muslim eyes. I'm glad that Friedman has a following of readers, for and against, in the Muslim world. Those Muslims, who have access to his columns, get a second opinion on events to think about.His general points of view where the Middle East is concerned are valuable reading for any American who seeks real representation of unfettered Muslim thought and the history behind it. Understanding, after all, is the first step in bridging the gap. I applaud Friedman for this.However, underneath all the great revelations and wisdom, lie certain biases about America and Isreal. Yes, he, a Jew, is right for his critiques of Arafat, the Saudi Royal family and other prominent figures who help in poisoning Muslim thought and retarding progress but at the same time, he oversimplifies and rationalizes behavior and policies taken by the West. This is somewhat hypocritical. His defense and excusing of Isreal and America on certain matters seem out of place among such decent reasoning in matters concerning Muslims.This book is great reading to gain insight about the state of the Middle East. However, the reader should think about the matters concerning Isreal and West which he quickly expedites in a few paragraphes. Friedman needs to take a better, more critical look at the inner workings of ""trade and economic development"". He uses these far too gratuitously. Policy influenced by big business and self advancement are not as simple, benign and wholesome as he leads on. It really does ""take two to tango"".In my opinion, the Arab liberalism he embraces and champions is a big part of the solution. I understand his frustration with the ignorance and distorted views of many Muslims. They are truly victims of a dark, neo-conservative, Islamist regime and educational system which the autocracies do nothing to change. Yes, it hinders progress, poisons thought, clouds vision and shifts blame. However, for his travels and experience, Friedman should have a better understanding of the faults of Western and Israeli policy and their share of the blame. The all-mighty dollar is not infallible. On that note, his gitty ""RA RA"" attitude toward ""globalization"" (as it is advertised) is rather one sided and naive. This attitude can be found in his previous book ""The Lexus and the Olive Tree"" which also, for all its scope on world problems, fails to look at the process of globalization from a more objective, truthful and analytical standpoint and dismisses its effects, abuses and growing pains in the rest of the world...not to mention the large gap between what it is and what it claims to be. Western-centric ""globalization"" is not a panacea for world progresss nor is it implemented as he would to think. Free Trade agreements should be a few pages not thousands. The vast majority of these agreements involve policies that are anything but ""free"".

1274,"The novel The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger is a powerful novel chronicling the life of an upper class teenage boy, Holden Caulfield during the early 1950's. Around this time, more and more people were conforming to society, dressing the same, acting the same, and through Holden, Salinger challenges those ideals. The book opens when Holden is expelled from yet another boarding school, because of his awful grades. He finds the world around him to be fake, and those people who demand him to conform to be phonies, not true to themselves. He sets off for New York City on his own, in a journey of self-exploration where he learns about love, life, and sex. As a troubled youth, he is a constant pessimist about the world around him, seeing it to be a mass conformist nation, without any true individuals, except for himself of course. His early life is troubled, and his younger brother's death shook him badly, and effected him deeply. Some of the pessimism comes from his older brother, a writer who in Holden's opinion became a prostitute for Hollywood, abandoning his own writing to work for the movies, selling out in the worst way.His parents seem vastly absent in the novel, perhaps suggesting that his parents are not role models for him, and while they may love him, they do not truly understand him. Without this adult guidance he mistrusts the adult world, a cynical view which pervades the whole book. This kind of teenage rebellion is something that the youth of today can easily relate to. Holden himself is an easily relatable character, and modern teens will find something of his character similar in themselves, whether that's his cynicism, or his constant thoughts about sex. He is confused by sex, but still finds it intriguing, and of course wants very badly to experience it. He goes on a date, with an old friend, and while he tries very badly to be charming, he cannot stand how absolutely fake he feels she is, and this leaves him disappointed with the world in general. In the end, he finds that while the world disappoints him, there is still good in it, and while he wanted very much to be away from people when he was with them he wanted them back once he had to live without them. This poignant tale of an adolescent growing up on his own in a world he despises is a must-read, one that can change one's views on the world, and on life. It teaches the importance of individuality, a love of beauty in all it's forms, and of one youth's perception of the world around us.",book

The story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film. I know what you're saying, ""its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it's supposed to scare you."" Well let me tell you something, the movie is not even scary in the least bit. Its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been. The acting was awful as well, along with the scariness of the murderer, who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off. Throughout the movie I kept getting a sense I was watching something that was thought up, written, produced, and directed by a high-schooler who watches too much pornography.

This piece of work seems to have been made ""under the radar"" and really, it's an entirely fascinating piece of work, that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent Aust. film making.<br /><br />At times it is rather slow and strange - it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head-movie'.

The cinematography is some of the most artful, beautiful and lyrical I've seen.

1290,"I liked Half-Life. I am still it's fan. It was frightening, intelligent and challenging. I don't tell any news it is one the best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm too hardcore Half-Life fan but the so called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2.<br /><br />And I have a question: is THIS the next chapter of Half-Life? Maybe the creators -Valve- thinks so but I don't. Where are the intelligent enemies? Where is the frightening atmosphere? Nowhere. I believe they wanted to make a bit different Half-Life (instead of another research station story), but they didn't just made a very different one, they made something that has to do with Half-Life like for example Quake does to Doom. The entire game so unsightly and unreal that it's almost forlorn.<br /><br />Though the physics are truly great and there were a few good level to play, the idea to make a revolutionary physic-driven gameplay has utterly failed. When you get the Gravity-gun, that can move objects, you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon- that would turn the schematic FPS gameplay upside down. The truth is, you can't use Gravity-gun as a real weapon. Why? Because the best you can do is throwing boxes and barrels that don't do much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it can fall from about 3 shots. If you want to throw an exploding barrel to your enemy it can explode in your own ""hand"". The gravity-gun doesn't work as a weapon. The best usage is solving some physic-puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is you must use your boring, schematic FPS weapons to the end(except for last level) Weapons are not that made original Half-life a classic. If Gravity-gun would be always like at the last level -a real weapon- I'd admire what Valve did. But not this. This is disappointing.<br /><br />So if you want Half-Life then you are searching at the wrong place. Maybe you will enjoy it but I repeat: it is everything but not Half-Life and even not a faithful continuation of that. This is the greatest disappointment of all time. Valve have shown they can make awful games too. They have managed that.",movie
1291,"For many years, I have been part of a Buddhist studies group that meets twice monthly in a Theravada temple. We have read and discussed many Suttas in the Pali canon, including the long and mid-length discourses and the Dhammapada. Last year, the group decided to venture out from Buddhist Scriptural texts and to read instead Professor Peter Harvey's book, ""An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics."" We approached the book, in essentially the same way that we approached the Suttas: we read the text, or portions of it, aloud in class and then discussed what we read. We skipped around among the chapters rather than taking them in order. Our group has now completed its reading of Harvey.Harvey uses the term `ethics' to describe three related issues: 1. thought on the bases and justification of moral guidelines and on the meaning of moral terms; 2.specific moral guidelines (applied ethics); 3 how people actually behave (descriptive ethics). (p. 2) Harvey in fact covers all three issues in his study, giving his work substantial breadth. To avoid confusion, it is important to keep the three uses of the term `ethics' in mind in approaching the book.The first three chapters of the book are the broadest and most interesting. In the first chapter, Harvey develops ""The Shared Foundations of Buddhist Ethics"". He offers an introduction to basic Buddhist teachings as they apply to ethics and he offers an insightful comparison of Buddhist approaches to ethics with the Aristotelian, utilitarian, and Kantian approaches of the West. In the second chapter, ""Key Buddhist Values"", Harvey explains the five precepts, the importance of lovingkindness and compassion and other key teachings that inform Buddhist understandings of ethical behavior. In the third chapter, Harvey discusses Mahayana Buddhism and compares and contrasts it with the Theravada school. He emphasizes throughout his book the diverse character of Buddhism, with different schools, and teachers within each school, having somewhat differing approaches to questions of ethics. If nothing else, Harvey's book shows the complexity of ethical questions, both in and outside of Buddhism, and the many ways these questions have been approached.The remaining seven chapters of the book treat in considerable detail of broad but specific ethical questions. These include Buddhist attitudes towards the natural world, economic ethics, war and peace, suicide and euthanasia, abortion and contraception, sexual equality, and homosexuality.In each chapter, Harvey follows the same basic approach.He begins with a definition of the question and proceeds to consider the manner in which the question is addressed in Buddhist Scriptures and other Buddhist texts. He then discusses how various Buddhist countries have, over time, in fact addressed, interpreted, or modified the Scriptural teachings. He comments upon various current approaches to the question. And each chapter ends with a useful summation or conclusion.I found Harvey made great effort to be rigorous and fair and to avoid the temptation to have his presentation of historical Buddhist teaching viewed through a contemporary prism. In our study group's consideration of the text, we had the liveliest discussions on those chapters which remain highly unsettled and which provoke disagreement: the chapters dealing with abortion and with sexual equality. Commendably, Harvey allows historical Buddhist texts to speak for themselves without overly-interpreting them in a way many people today would find more appealing. Harvey's chapter on war and peace also resulted in an interesting discussion in our group. Harvey explores whether Buddhist teachings allow for the waging of what is known as a ""just war."" He then discusses the ways that some Buddhist societies have, at different times, rationalized the waging of war and the oppression of minority groups by reading protection for the claimed enemies outside of the scope of the Buddhist texts. It is a candid picture and all-too-familiar for students in the West.For all its virtues, Harvey's book had difficulties in the way we approached it in the study group. Harvey writes clearly and carefully, but highly academically. His book is dry, almost lifeless in places. In the long weeks we spent with it, our group had difficulty keeping in focus and following the continuity of the book. At times, the book seemed more like an encyclopedia or a legal hornbook than as a record of a living Buddhism. Harvey's book emphasizes the difficulty and diversity of ethical thought and seems to lead to what in other contexts Buddhist teachings might describe as a profusion of views. The book pays insufficient attention to meditation rather than simply argument as a source of ethical understanding. Most of these comments are basically another way of saying that this form of academic study is not as useful as a study of the Suttas for an understanding of Buddhism. Harvey's book should not be faulted too heavily for that. But I do think it would have worked better in a college classroom or in private reading than in a Sutta studies class.Harvey does quote several times a key text from the Dhammapada (verse 163) which is itself an excellent introduction to Buddhist ethical thought:""Not to do any evil,To cultivate what is wholesome,To purify one's mind:This is the teaching of the Buddhas.""Readers wishing a detailed consideration of Buddhist approaches to ethical questions will benefit from Harvey's book.Robin Friedman",book

1298,"When people harp on about how ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" then just point them towards this fantastically entertaining, and quaint-looking, comedy horror from writer-director Glenn McQuaid.<br /><br />It's a tale of graverobbers (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) who end up digging up more than just silent, immobile corpses. After the initial shock of this they soon realise that they can actually turn the situation to their advantage. And that's just what they try to do. Mind you, it seems as if things may not have worked out quite as they planned as poor young Arthur (Monaghan) is actually relating his tale to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows.<br /><br />Looking at the detail of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken the core of his first, short movie and expanded it to this feature effort, which is no bad thing. Fessenden returns and does well, Monaghan is one of those guys who can actually still get you to like him while he goes about the nefarious business of stealing from the dead and with other genre favourites such as Perlman and Angus Scrimm on the scene this film is a lot of fun for genre fans.<br /><br />It also benefits from a unique and favourable design and look, at times moving from E.C. Comic-style panels into live action (a la Creepshow) and always somehow feeling quite authentic in it's Hammer Horror feel. Maybe everything is just covered over with so much dry ice but that's beside the point. Whatever was done to capture everything on film, it works. It works well.<br /><br />It may not have any actual scares but this film does have a great vein of black humour and definitely soaks every minute of it's runtime in macabre material that should please all of those who have the patience for horror that's a little bit more sedate and feels like it definitely could have been made back in the days of Hammer.<br /><br />See this if you like: The Flesh And The Fiends, The Doctor And The Devils, Creepshow.",movie

This coming of age story of Hailey Baumbauer, a 17 yr old girl living in the remote suburbs of upper new york is absurd. Kowalski does a good job of getting you to connect with the characters early on, but fails miserably at capturing your attention with a likely story or believable plot. This is the first book that I have ever stopped reading because the story line just got progessively worse until I could not bear the misery of continuing to read it. I would recammend this book perhaps for a junior high school or preteen reading level, but nothing beyond that.

1301,"This is an installment in the notorious Guinea Pig series. A short lived japanese TV-show, that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show. This short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any story. A group of guys have captured a young woman. They tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her. They beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her and finally, in ""loving"" closeup, push a needle through her eye. This is the most straightforward of all the Guinea Pig movies, and one of the first. It was probably this film, more than any of the others, that gave Guinea Pig the rumour of being snuff. They certainly gave inspiration to Nicolas Cage's movie ""8 mm."". These movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles. They have progressed to more polished, but equally graphic movies like ""Naked Blood"". They probably fill the void left by the Mondo movies, that got slightly cleaned up and became reality TV.

Season 6 gave us a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedies that undermined the show's continuity and, frankly, made Simpsons' Halloween Specials look like great thriller TV.<br /><br />In this episode Victoria Jackson of SNL fame plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker. However her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and Mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town.<br /><br />There's some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none-too-sophisticated characterization of Midwestern hicks.

1303,Such a fun place to try out a few unique Brazilian eats like the Tapioca Crepe. It was an awesome alternative to your regular breakfast option! The texture of the crepe is nice and chewy and works for both savoury and sweet! This is perfect for those who like mochi and all things chewy!! So much fun to eat! I ordered the Buffalo Chicken filling which worked pretty well with the crepe but I think a sweet filling would work even better! Will have to try the dessert version next time! Other than the crepe I also ordered the Monster Extravagant Chocolate Shake. This is the ultimate shake to fulfill all your happiness! Even seeing this massive monster will make you grin from ear to ear! The service was really quick and friendly for the weekend as I had ordered the crepe in advance and it was ready by the time I arrived with no one in line. And we ordered the milkshake on the spot and it took about 10 min to make - perfect timing as we were chowing down on the crepe. Overall a nice place to try out something new!!,restaurant

1306,"&quot;When I was a young boy, if I was sick or in trouble, or had been beaten at school, I used to remember that on the day I was born my father had wanted to kill me.&quot;This is the opening line of The Last of the Wine. I anticipated finding a weak, sickly protagonist, plagued by misfortune. This was not the case. I found a man who lived his life in dignity, honor, and devotion, even with such a humbling beginning to his life.Alexias, the narrator and protagonist of this story, matures and grows to manhood during the Peloponnesian War, in its final days. Alexias reaches young adulthood without the benefit of a father for many years, believing him to be dead, and takes over as head of the family, caring for his stepmother and sister, defending his honor, and the honor of his father, as others try to corrupt him. He is fair of looks, posessed of good health, and strives to better himself, body and mind, throughout the book.He meets and falls in love with Lysis, another Athenian boy, and the two form a life-long bond of friendship and devotion to one another, which extends to Alexias compromising himself to rescue the virtue and honor of Thalia, the bride of Lysis, when famine comes to Athens.I think one of my favorite aspects of Mary Renault's novels is her treatment of homosexual subject matter is not only extraordinary for the time her books were written, but also reads as though the sexual nature of the friendships, especially the one between Lysis and Alexias, is secondary to the genuine love and caring they feel for one another. Mary Renault's gentle treatment of, at the time, such taboo subject matter, never comes across as censored, or stifled, in any way.This book is about many things; friendship, honor, principle, love, committment, and sense of duty. Of all the Mary Renault books I have now read, I find this to be the most complete telling of the life of a man in ancient Greece. The reader travels with Alexias, from his formative years as a boy, through his training as a soldier, his belief that as head of his family he must provide and care for them, his stepping down from that role when his 'not so dead as he thought' father returns to Athens, his struggle with complying with his father's wishes, while trying to retain the values and beliefs he has instilled in himself during his father's absence, and so much more. We see him risk his life to fight alongside Lysis to see Athens freed, not only because he knew it to be the right thing for himself and the people, but because Lysis believed in it, and his love for Lysis was enough for him to support the cause, even if it meant his own death.I dare to say that I will never find another author so in love with this time period that they can re-create it with such beauty and passion. I hope that other readers will enjoy all of Mary Renault's books as much as I have.",book
1307,"This movie is sort of similar to ""Better Off Dead"" as it has some of the same stars. This one though isn't quite as good.

While there they meet this girl who's trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant. This guy really doesn't seem to like lobsters, cause in one scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts in a stethoscope so he can hear it scream. The main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant. Somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown, kind of like in ""Summer Rental"" though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better.

1314,"What a sad sight these TV stalwarts make, running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and shabby, and it's not helped by a ""big name"" star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he's given in a credible fashion.<br /><br />At no time do the supporting cast rise above the material; they're clearly watching the clock here. Bang out the scenes, get the pay cheque, go home, and try to forget all about it.<br /><br />It's not particularly badly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's just utterly anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras. The pacing is a little bizarre; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts, which makes it feel irrelevant.<br /><br />Maiden Voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored, and for being a fun game of ""spot the Kiwi bit parters""; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess.

1322,"This book primarily covers the intelligence activities of England from the end of World War I through the end of World War II. There is a some discussion of activities going back as far as the mid 1800's and to quite recent times as viewed from relatively current publications of the doctrine manuals of the US Army.Note here that this is a coverage of all aspects of intelligence, not just the codebreaking that has been the subject of so many books in recent years. Code breaking is discussed, but so is the use of the material so obtained and the use of other types of intelligence such as old fashioned spies or whatever. Then he talks about the uses of intelligence by the various commanders in the field. Sometimes they used it well, sometimes, like with McArthur he ignored it if it didn't fit into his plans. He also comments on the counter intelligence operations conducted by the various countries during World War II.Dr. Ferris brings in a lot of new data, and a few new conclusions that reflect his own analysis of what was going on at the time. He also shows some interesting side lights, for instance in researching a relatively minor war in the 1920's he finds documents from the commanders of both sides in the files. The conclusion was clear that during these years when most of us assume not much was happening, someone (in England) was intercepting and was breaking the codes of both powers. Codebreaking didn't fall into Allied hands with the Enigma machine, it had been going on all along.",book

1324,"I've been back several times now, and I keep wanting to like this place more than I do. So far, the best item I've eaten has been the Boeuf Bourguignon on a toasted baguette. Even though it lacks the rich sauce, the flavors are on point. It wouldn't make sense to serve true Boeuf Bourguignon on bread anyway, so this meal actually works, as long as you're not expecting the traditional red wine sauce. This is probably the only meal I would recommend, the one that didn't need any adjustments. 

Other than this meal, the rest has been a disappointment. 

The burger I had was expensive and mediocre. It wasn't well seasoned, and the side of fries wasn't all that appetizing. They were unevenly cooked and cold. The worst part, though, was that there was some sort of paprika or seasoning on them that made them taste bitter and stale. I would not recommend this combination. Spending $20 on a burger and fries wouldn't be horrible, but I've gotten some amazing burgers for almost half the price. Seriously, this is just a rip-off, and the grilled cheese sandwich is even worse. It's a mess of soggy, oil-drenched bread with a smattering of something that resembles cheese but has no flavor. 

More recently, I had a meal that was far, far, far too salty and floating in grease. It makes me think the chefs don't taste what they make. It's always unappetizing when cooking oil takes on the red or orange color of the food, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that there was about an inch of grease that looked like industrial-grade motor oil on top of this dish. The flavors were good, layered and richly flavorful, but the meat was fatty and rather tough. I don't think I will be ordering this again, but my friend had a good meal from this restaurant, though she also complained about too much salt. At least the prices at this restaurant are more reasonable.

The chicken nachos were cold but very flavorful. Seriously, these are unique with wonderful spices that are deeply complex but not overwhelming. The texture is great, too. The added spiced pepitas add a great crunch. Despite the unappealing temperature, this is a dish I would still recommend, as long as you're OK with the temperature. If you order them to go, you can easily heat them up. 

I'll probably give Rosetta Hall at least one more try. I'm determined to find out why there are so many four- and five-star reviews when the service is not always all that friendly and you're likely to spend far more than what the meal is worth.

1327,"This was the third Muppet movie and the last one Jim Henson was around to take part in the making of before his premature death in 1990. The first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before I was born. I originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy, ""The Muppet Movie"" and ""The Great Muppet Caper"", around the mid-nineties, as a kid, but didn't see this third one, ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"", until April 2007. This was shortly after I had seen its two predecessors and 1996's ""Muppet Treasure Island"" for the first time in many years. This third Muppet movie definitely didn't disappoint me the first time I saw it, and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much, but if not, it certainly didn't go too far downhill.<br /><br />The Muppets' stage musical, ""Manhattan Melodies"", turns out to be a big hit on their college campus. They are graduating from college, so they will soon be leaving, but decide they will all stay together and go to Manhattan to try and get their show on Broadway. After their arrival, they begin searching for a producer, but after many rejections, they finally decide to part and go find jobs. Most of them leave town, but Kermit stays, and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the Muppet gang. He gets a job at a New York restaurant owned by a man named Pete. The frog quickly befriends Pete's daughter, Jenny, an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father's restaurant as a waitress. As Kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom, now with the help of Jenny, he doesn't know that Miss Piggy has secretly stayed in New York and is now spying on him. She begins to see Kermit and Jenny together, and to her it looks like they're getting close, which leads to jealousy! <br /><br />When I saw this movie for the second time, it looked disappointing at first. It seemed a little rushed, unfocused, and maybe even forgettable around the beginning. There are some funny bits during this part of the film, such as Animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus, but for a little while, the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors. Fortunately, it wasn't long before that changed. The film is entertaining for the most part, with ""Saying Goodbye"", the poignant song the Muppets sing as they part, and a lot that happens after that. The two funniest parts MIGHT be Miss Piggy's tantrums after she sees Kermit and Jenny hugging, but there were definitely many other times when I laughed, such as poor Fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears. The Muppets still have their charm and comical antics, which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part, as does the plot, a simple but intriguing one for all ages. There are some weaker moments, such as the Muppet babies sequence, and Juliana Donald's performance as Jenny is lacklustre, but neither of these problems are too significant, and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience.<br /><br />I would say ""The Muppet Movie"", the film that started the franchise in 1979, is the best of the original trilogy, and that seems to be the most popular opinion. This third film is probably the weakest of the three, but all of them are good. Unlike ""Muppets From Space"", the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after Henson's sad passing, at least ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" is still the Muppets! I won't go into details about what I think of the Muppets' 1999 film, released twenty years after their first one, since I've already explained in my review of it why I found it so disappointing, and even though it does have some appeal, I'm clearly not alone. However, every theatrical movie starring the lovable Muppets that was made during Henson's life is good entertainment for the whole family, even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it.",movie

Granted this is a movie meaning things that won't happen in normal life happen here, however this movie is more far fetched than theories that no child left behind is working. All of these people are in the house and nobody has noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to be coming everywhere but in its cage. I could deal with an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour i just can't take it, i would rather kill myself than see that damn owl again. Did i laugh during this movie? no. Not even once? no. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. The fact that this pile of garbage is capped off with Ashton Kutcher bending his boss over and taking his pants off in front of everybody just makes this movie ever worse. But wait, the day is saved because the damn owl can fly. WOW AMAZING! However, i do give this movie some cred, its not as bad as Epic Movie.....",movie

Then, they took away my shot when it was still half full. No problem. Ordered more. My crawfish finally arrived, and they were large, well cooked, and tasty; a little too much butter for my taste, but that is the oriental way in Austin - still delicious. So, I ordered 2 more pounds. I watched in some dismay as they served crawfish to several other customers - - but not to me. After 30 more minutes, at 2:40 I was disgusted and left.

I remember my initial reaction being: 1) annoyingly overacted, 2)under produced 3) unlikeable characters<br /><br />Well, two years later I watched some episodes again and didn't find it nearly as annoying. A year later I was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it's bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everybody, and I'm sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now.

1336,"Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in a dozen films, but who has never really registered for me. Often stolid, taciturn, playing the same kinds of roles and looking somewhat like the similarly underrated Glenn Ford, he's an actor that takes some effort to really appreciate; but once you hit the right film....<br /><br />And this is it. Preminger's moody look at New York's underbelly is as dirty and seedy as just about any 50s noir, and Andrews is in his element as too-tough cop Mark Dixon who just doesn't know how to play the game to get ahead: he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules. Early on in the film, he accidentally kills the witness to a murder involving an illegal crap game set up by a mobster who Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of ""justice"". Along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and also has to try to get her father off the hook for the murder.<br /><br />Stunningly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with hard and sparkling dialogue by Ben Hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two of time, this is another noir for the ages and might be my favorite Preminger film thus far -- it's every bit as good as the more-heralded Laura.",movie

1344,"Jan Hunt's 'The Natural Child' is a timely and important classic belonging to a trend towards more compassionate, respectful and scientifically-informed parenting. First and foremost, it is a well-researched and authoritative text. Further, it is refreshingly simple and easy to digest, making it an inviting read. What I particularly loved about this book is that Jan Hunt is not afraid to challenge myths and misconceptions, and to confront commonly held negative attitudes towards children. This book is passionately written in advocacy of children's rights and their developmental needs. It exudes an uncompromising respect for children's dignity. My favourite section is the one about 'The Hidden Messages We Give Our Children'. In a delightfully humorous tone, this section challenges us to take a good look at ourselves as parents; the mixed messages we unconsciously give our children, and the painful double-binds this places them in. There is much we can all learn from these pages. I give this book a big thumbs-up.",book
1345,"This book is interesting in that it not only examines the key political issues of the antebellum period but also delves into the culture of the time, especially that of South. But the author's views are tilted toward those of the antebellum South. He goes to great length in describing the Southern plantation system with its incorporation of slave labor and compares it somewhat favorably with the industrialization and the ""so-called"" free labor of the North. In addition, the exaggerated Southern claims of social superiority seem to strike a chord with the author.A great deal of the book is consumed with describing the reactions and views of leading spokesmen and of various publications in the North and the South concerning major antebellum political developments. The question of the Mexican Cession and the Wilmot Proviso in 1846 moved the question of slavery squarely into the political system resulting in the formation of the Free Soil Party and talk of secession in the South. The Compromise of 1850 quieted some voices, but only until the next expansion of slavery.Interestingly, of all of the political crises of the mid-1850s where slavery was front and center, that is, the Kansas-Nebraska bill, the bleeding Kansas crisis, and the Dred Scott decision, the author claims that the Southern response was relatively moderate compared to the extremists of the North. Yet that moderation seemed to have evaporated with the John Brown raid at Harpers Ferry. And the Southern reaction to Lincoln's election the next year was beyond shrill and ultimately self-destructive.I think it is fairly obvious that this author regards the Civil War as occurring as a result of emotionalism and opportunism run amok. And despite the fact that the South was unwilling to honor the untainted election of a President and failed to comprehend that all of the conservative candidates together far outpolled the Republican, I believe that the author holds that Northern forces largely provoked the Southern secession and then were unwilling to accept that fact by offering some kind of compromise.This author fails to grasp, or at least state, that slavery and its ramifications were the great moral issues of the day. Of course, tremendous emotionalism was evoked by the issues. And those issues could not be simply managed or downplayed in the Second American Party system. Slavery was conceptually wrong for America and produced an unsustainable divide between two sections of the country. Emotionalism may have obscured that fact then and now, but it is superficial as an explanation for the Civil War.",book
1346,"This is an extraordinarilly well-written book by someone whose knowledge in depth and breadth is full enough for the subject! I bought it expecting a feminist commentary. Instead I found a women's commentary. This book may show you the difference. Her technique allows different views to be presented (e.g., both Sarah and Hagar have voices; the rabbies, ""our mothers,"" and ""modern sages"" have their say). She also engages in delightful touches, such as giving the recipe for the infamous bowl of porridge for which Esau sold his birthright.Dr.Frankel has great credentials. My only disappointments are that there was no sequal and that there were no citation notes for the rabbinical stories until the end of the book. These are not criticisms; only a reflection of how well she leaves you wanting more.

1352,"I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally). Umm, this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff, I really haven't seen anything that good and I can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times. The show is like a Late Show wanna be/Colbert Report wanna be with it's politics also, if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal, this humor gets old also, McCain is old, yeah yeah, whatever. Libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would endear themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves, so it's almost every show bash McCain or Palin, sheesh. So we get the same old vids of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some leftist political humor that never laugh's at itself out of it's own weakness. I'll keep watching since I watch at work and it's all that's on, hoping that I'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old. I did like the fill in host's of Chris and Alison though, they were actually a good change of pace; maybe this show could do a rotating host thing. Olivia who I thought at times in the beginning was really funny has resorted to this constant pouting response and it's getting old, lol. 7 of 10; it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger Baby Boomer like me (mid 40's).

1354,"I recently re-read this book, which I'd enjoyed as a child (forty years ago). Today, it seems rather dismal to me - horrible poverty, illness, the pat happy ending and children who are horribly gushing over their mother. Yet, years back, what I most liked about the story was that, being a very independent and mature child myself, Polly and Ben succeed very well at taking on adult responsibilities.Though I'm at a loss about explaining exactly how the author does so, I've found that this is a book which every reader interprets differently - and that shows an amazing depth. My own mother remembers reading it as a child, and being moved by the familial devotion and respect for the matriarch. As other posts here make clear, it can reach each of us on a different level.This book is a worthy addition to any child's library. However, I'd leave a single caveat: do not use it to prompt &quot;a talk,&quot; especially on the &quot;look how good you have it today&quot; theme. Let the era introduce itself. It was a time of great poverty for many, yet also one which idealised a form of &quot;perfect&quot; family relationships which no one could hope to have.

1356,"As Kuper states, ""The core of this book is ... an evaluation of what has been the central project in postwar American cultural anthropology"" (x). More explicitly, in the first part of the book, he details the French and German ideals of culture that grew out of the Enlightenment. ""Part Two: Experiments"" looks at how Clifford Geertz, David Schneider, and Marshall Sahlins respectively have constructed anthropologies of culture in response to various intellectual influences. As he explains in the moving introduction, he lived through South Africa during the Apartheid when the very concept of culture was used to legitimize the most inhumane kinds of violence and racism imaginable. Because of this, Kuper is very much a skeptic when it comes to any kind of belief that use of the word ""culture"" communicates any objective, essential quality about people or the way they live their lives.As I hinted at above, the argument starts in Europe, and migrates across the Atlantic Ocean. Kuper suggests that German intellectuals (Mannheim, Jaspers, and Mann more recently, but the concept dates back to Herder) believed in Kultur or Bildung - a kind of ""cultured state by way of a process of education and spiritual development"" which is ""bounded in time and space and is coterminous with a national identity"" (30). The French version of culture, with its haughty, transnational cosmopolitanism and materialism was perceived to be a direct threat to local distinctive cultures.Kuper then goes on to detail Talcott Parson's conception of culture as a tripartite endeavor between the psychologist, anthropologist, and sociologist, each of whom would understand culture as a semiological system of how we use symbols. He calls Geertz a Parsonian, and takes him to task for analyzing signs and symbols outside of social structure. He gives a detailed account of Geertz's hermeneutical account of the Balinese cockfight in his book ""The Interpretation of Cultures,"" suggesting that Geertz's lack of sociological concern in his anthropology leaves only an idealist approach to interpretation which is radically separated from social conditions.David Schneider, the second anthropologist Kuper takes up, is known for his study of kinship relations. However, he completely divorced this pursuit from anything like an idea of ""relationship"" or ""blood lines."" It should be noted that this is a fairly extreme version of relativism that not even many anthropologists adopt, and Kuper goes to lengths to point this out. Schneider makes the somewhat peculiar statement that ""since it is perfectly possible to formulate ... the cultural construct of ghosts without actually visually inspecting even a single specimen, this should be true across the board and without reference to the observability or non-observability of objects that may be presumed to be the referents of the cultural referents"" (133). For Schneider, culture is wholly symbolic and arbitrary.The best part of the chapter on Marshall Sahlins is Kuper's retelling of Sahlins' debate with Gananath Obeyesekere, the Princeton professor of anthropology. At the heart of the debate was the nature of rationality of ""native peoples"" (the debate specifically focused around Captain Cook and the Hawaiian Islands). Obeyesekere maintained that anything short of admitting that native people and Westerners think similarly is another way of saying that they are hopefully different, irrational, and uncivilized. Sahlins, however, holds that the rationality of native peoples is wholly and completely unknowable to those in the Occident. The closing chapters of the book are scathing rebukes of postmodernism, and especially its influence on the American anthropological tradition in the 1980s and 1990s, claiming that it has ""a paralyzing effect on the discipline [of anthropology]"" (223).The twentieth century has certainly given the reader plenty of reasons to look askance at the very notion of culture. However, I am not sure that I am ready to completely do away with it as a powerful explanatory tool, no matter how diaphanous it may occasionally seem. I would definitely recommend the book for anyone interested in trends in twentieth-century American anthropology, and especially their intellectual genealogies. Whatever conclusions you have drawn about culture and what it means, I can guarantee you that this book will challenge them, and will do so thoughtfully.",book

1361,"This is a Hollywood film. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This film will not change the world. However, it is well-made, well-plotted, and well-acted, which counts for a lot.<br /><br />It's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former-CIA assassin who feels betrayed chasing a Secret Service agent who was protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992-or certainly in contemporary America, this would-be assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the President. He imagines he has common cause with Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood at his cool, calm, good-naturedly grouchy best) who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the Warren Commission, blamed Horrigan-unfairly, Leary believes-for the assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is ratcheted up through some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary wanting to keep Horrigan close but not to betray his location and plans.<br /><br />Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines a fellow agent with whom Horrigan develops a grown- up relationship. It is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is a fair deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the quick-witted Horrigan in friendly banter. It is a nice part for Russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man. The acting by the leads, Wolfgang Peterson's competent direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this a film I can watch over and over.",movie

1363,"On many levels it's very good. In fact, considering that this was a low-budget British indie by a first time feature-director with a largely neophyte cast, it's a magnificent achievement. I don't know how much it cost. The figure of ¬£8,000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is. The point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that Great special effects, terrific production design, effective props and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix. Even having said that, much of the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. This is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless blanks but these were ten characters - mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things. Throughout the middle act, when the plot was developing, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole film was like the second act, it would be stunning.<br /><br />Before the ship blows up, twelve people make it to individual escape pods or 'e-pods' which blast away from the ship. They're not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped, cramped and have no real idea where they're going - but that makes sense. I like the e-pods - they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice, roomy escape capsule. I also like the way that we are specifically told, later, that they are designed for ship-to-ship escape but can just about make planetfall in an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet. That said, it doesn't look to me like there are 116 unused e-pods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e-pod - but in he gets. (And it has just occurred to me: shouldn't the Captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the first guy out of there?) Anyway, the e-pods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it will be exactly the same all over. We have to accept that all the e-pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up, firing flares into the sky to locate each other.<br /><br />The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try and contact 'Captain Behan' with whom they were intending to rendezvous. But they cannot do this from the planet, they need to get into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti-grav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere. It can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. The captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired e-pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team. That's Kid. I really liked the way that he now points out that his name is David and the Captain starts using it, treating him with dignity and respect. That was good storytelling and good characterisation.",movie

1366,"The perspective of the former SEC chairman can be very useful for ordinary investors. I learned, for example, how and why some important accounting standards were changed in recent times. This helps me to read financial reports with a better focus. The politics of the investment community was also very interesting. The letters from politicians to the SEC, questioning SEC's proposal to limit the amount of consulting work that accounting firms could do for their audit clients, were particularly enlightening. The expose of how a small group of people can influence policies of public interest is already worthy of the price. I was not completely naive before, but reading such letters from people who gained power by claiming to be protectors of public interest swings the argument for more safeguards for small investors. Self-regulation of professional bodies simply does not work, at least as far as the accounting profession is concerned.I would have been even happier if the book were to go deeper, and gave more examples, on the issue of number games, in place of the last chapter, on 401K. But the existing chapters on accounting tricks already contained more beef than those in the other book, 'Financial Shenangans' by Schilit, which were very repetitive and not much depth.",book

I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names.",book

Hard to follow, strange editing, disjointed storyline, the characters mumble, all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time.

1370,"Francoise and Pierre Labrousse are a couple. Xaviere is a student from Rouen. Xaviere's real life has yet to begin. Pierre suggests that perhaps he and Francoise can help Xaviere manage to live in Paris.When Xaviere comes to live in the same hotel as Francoise, she spends much of her time alone in her room. After the rehearsal of Pierre's play, Pierre and Francoise go to a bar by habit. When Pierre becomes interested in a person he is able to carry on a conversation for hours with angelic ferocity. This is part of his generosity. Francoise persuades Xaviere to accompany her to the bar.An example of Xaviere's thinking is Xaviere holds that concerts are a ridiculous convention since it is silly to arrange to hear music at a certain time. Pierre speaks of his confounded mania for making a conquest. While Pierre is acting Francoise is able to work on her novel. After Xaviere moves to Paris Francoise finds that she has little free time.At a party Francoise and Pierre's sister Elisabeth view the actresses as having an embalmed youth to their appearances. Francoise believes that the life of Pierre and hers that is perfect as to form is beginning to lose its substance. She becomes ill and has to move to a nursing home for care. The night of the New Year's Eve party Pierre had offered to give up Xaviere and now it seems to Francoise that Xaviere and Pierre are in love.When Francoise and Pierre are in the presence of Xaviere she becomes upset because she, Xaviere, feels her feelings are being dissected. Since Pierre and Francoise are supposed to have a perfect love, she, Francoise, becomes annoyed when Pierre and Xaviere bring their love to her attention. Francoise endeavors to focus on everyone as part of a trio. Elisabeth thinks that Xaviere is a sly fickle girl. Francoise comes to the realization that watching Xaviere so closely is squalid.Both Pierre and Francoise seek to influence Xaviere and she suffers from their attention. In the end Francoise chooses to be alone, Pierre is in the service, (it is 1940 or so and the war is going on), and Xaviere is estranged. (Alternatively Francoise and Xaviere end up dead.)This is the novel, I have read, in which the author worked out her ideas about freedom, existentialism, and in turn transmitted them to Jean Paul Sartre for philosophical exposition. I have also read that situations such as the one described here gave rise to ethical complaints from parents causing De Beauvoir to lose her license to teach.

1373,"OK, here it is: ""Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama."" What we do is, first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a Germanic accent, and we let him flounder around between French, German, American, and British for over 2 hours. Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly. But just to make sure the viewer doesn¬¥t fall asleep, we throw in details which are shockingly absurd, such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet. Naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of Lhasa in 1943, speak perfect English, also with dubious accents. Of course, the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this: we have the Dalai Lama befriend the now-reformed Nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west. In return, our hero learns from his young proteg√© a kind of vague, undefined Buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion. We also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the Tibetan society accords the Dalai Lama, even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist, sort of, in his own way, even though we ourselves don¬¥t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go. And last but not least, we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the Chinese have treated the Tibetans (which is certainly true), thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a ""political"" movie, even though it is nothing of the sort. So, zat ist my idea. Vat do you zink? Can ve make zis movie?",movie

Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his dad who is a barrister, since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the society and as a result hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams, he gets married to his love gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to england and become a barrister just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony. This angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt, he loses his wife and children.

1376,I read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything I expected it to be and more.This is the way a proper horror movie should be.I think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic. The spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out.It was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated.The special effects were very good.I would love to see more horror movies like this one.This is easily one of my favorite's.A realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie.Other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches.I will be adding it to my collection.The DVD has some interesting special features.,movie

1383,"This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and in an interview, Jackie said it was his favorite as well. It contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well. This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used parts in Rapid Fire, and was also lifted in Tango and Cash, which used some of the opening scenes.<br /><br />Jackie plays a policeman in Hong Kong. The story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as Jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil Ku (who is one of the greatest villains in any Jackie Chan movie.) You can expect some very funny scenes as Jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend, played by Maggie Chung. His job is to protect Ku's secretary who has enough information to take him down, but even that poses many problems. Jackie is at his absolute best here. The last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone - period. It was the most intense fight I have ever seen Jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights. All in all, one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands. He was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage.<br /><br />All in all, another Chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies. By the end of this movie, you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen. So many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore - Jackie had to take responsibility himself. There are no gimmicks, wires or stand-ins - it is all true-life action that is a treat to watch. It is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now. If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or action in general, give yourself a treat and watch this movie. It is truly sensational.",movie

My friends and I were in the area and they let me pick what to have for lunch so I chose this homestyle, quick Filipino lunch spot! I had the tapsilog and they all tried the sinigang (Filipino lunch special). They loved it and I enjoyed my meal as well!

The food came really quick (probably 5-10 minutes or less) and my friends were very shocked! I explained to them that many quick lunch spots in the Philippines were like this especially in Metro Manila where people prefer to grab lunch as quick as possible and go back to work. This place brought me right back to those days!

1386,"I commanded A Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Cav under LTC Hal Moore at X-Ray. I lived the battle and led two aasaults. Hal Moore's book is an accurate account of the events of those two days and reflects his love for his soldiers as well as his determination to close with the enemy. As another reviewer described the book shortly after it was published it is &quot;the best description of small unit combat since the Red badge of Courage&quot;. Having just read 71 reviews I note that some of the reviewers criticize Moore on issues of tactical considerations. Without going into a lot of detail the Hueys did well to carry 6 soldiers at the altitude of the central highlands of Vietnam. We did not have good intelligence as to where the enemy was so the operation was planned as a reconaissance in force. Not much different than hundreds of other air assaults by both Army and Marine units during the war. The book was not written to glorify war but to demonmstrate the courage and character of the American soldier.",book

Here we have real literature with a capital L and here we have real imagination too. Based on the original tale, alert readers will love how a master writer converts the simple to the complex, the silly to the profound, and yet keeps us entertained as he goes.

1388,"Unfit for Command can be read in about 4-5 hours. The book demonstrates using Senator Kerry's own words and writings that he has a history of being very self-absorbed in propelling his own ambitions. In the process he has demonstrated a lack of honesty, and loyalty. These two traits are essential in being Commander and Chief of the United States military, which Mr. O'Neil argues he does not have and thus should not be elected President of the United States.Some argue well there is no testimoney of the men under him in the book, so the book must be wrong. Two things about this accusation need to be investigated. First there is Mr. Gardner's tesitomey, who didn't like him in Nam and still doesn't, but did serve under him longer than any of the other Band of Brothers. Does this disqualify his testimony in court no, but it does bring into question his motive. So to state no one under his command gave testimony is false. Secondly, those members on Kerry's Band of Brothers were contacted but stated they couldn't talk, by request of the Kerry campaign. Those men with Kerry have more of a vested interest in seeing him win than those who were interviewed in this book, so shouldn't there statements be looked at just as suspicious. Saying their testimony is more trustworthy than the Swiftees is a baseless argument, for who knows what has been promised to them. In saying you wouldn't recommend this book because nobody under him was interviewed is a pretty closed-minded position and displays a lack of logic. In court it wouldn't matter both they, the Band of Brothers, and the other eyewitnesses on the scene would have equal wait, it is a straw man argument trying to fog the issue.",book

1390,"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).<br /><br />There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental. The splendid performances of Ford's stock company, (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr, Ward Bond, Jane Darwell etc), adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full-bodied star performance is Joanne Dru's Denver. Dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were Bond and Johnson, who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an Oscar for his work in ""The Last Picture Show"". As he said himself, 'It couldn't have happened to a nicer fella'. Add Bert Glennon's superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of Americana that couldn't have some from anyone other than Ford.

1391,"OK, 4 stars is rather generous, but it's hard to rate a book like this on anything but entertainment value. And its value as entertainment is quite high as Ebert selects from his years of reviews and offers insights into some of the worst films ever.I consider Ebert - the columnist, but not the TV version - to be the best of the mainstream critics (the ones who don't pick and chose and write about eight films a year for New Yorker). Reviewing bad films in a good way shows his strengths. Granted, you don't have to buy this to read many of these reviews - his Web site has a pretty good archive going back to 1985. But it's worth it just for the fun. As you read it, take note of which actors and directors appear in more than one flop - yes, Bruce Willis, I'm talking to you! See if you agree with him about those films you saw. And ponder why some clinkers - like so many bad super-hero films - are not here.It's a lot cheaper than seeing all these joys of the cinema.",book

It wants to be a sort of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it just isn't that funny, unless you find the name General Wombat (?) funny. It comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes, when it springs to life. There are many, many flat scenes in the Whitehouse between the president and his aides which don't work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb ransom storyline and the suicide bomber attacks, which i think are meant to be played for laughs, but again, aren't that funny. The location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap TV. I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this. Only laugh: Connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane. It makes Never say Never again look like genius.",movie
1394,"I am making my way through Charles Dickens...not in any particular order...the first few I've picked are mostly familiar through TV or film adaptations that I've enjoyed and/or on the recommendations of friends.""Bleak House"" was my first read, finished last month. ""Great Expectations"" is my second read.What can I say? I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, ""Great Expectations"" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning ""Be Careful What You Wish For..."", 2) it is the complete opposite of ""Catcher in the Rye"" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer ""phonies"" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an ""old"" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of ""The Aged"" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)",book

1401,"Your Wildest Fantasy or a Dystopic Nightmare?An unlimited supply of state-sanctioned hallucinogenic drugs with no ill effects. Free sex, free contraceptives, and no relationships or commitments to worry about. No illnesses or unsightly aging. Unlimited access to recreation and games. A government committed to maintaining everyone's happiness. And this is a bad thing?Actually, it is. For this is the Brave New World, set in A.F. 632 (approx 2544). While on its surface it may seem like some wild fantasy, the harsh reality of life in the World State is one where individualism has been extinguished long ago, along with religion, art, poetry, and philosophy. In its place is a materialistic, strictly controlled world where the New State (the totalitarian government) is in total control. Except for a few outposts of Savage settlements (such as the Native Americans), the new world is completely homogenized into one entity, whose citizens are divided into 5 distinct castes.The most disturbing aspect of this society is the idea of ""playing God."" Humans are merely produced in an assembly line, set to mimic the uterine conditions of a fetus. Indeed, the assembly workers partake of various tasks, designed to condition the fetuses for their pre-destined castes. The lower castes are starved of oxygen and nutrition to make them inferior, while the Bokanovsky and Podsnap processes enable scores of human clones to be produced in rapid succession. Then, once they are decanted (born), they are ""conditioned"" (brainwashed) as children into accepting their status with happy abandonment.Another disturbing element is the severing of all ties to the family and motherhood. The words ""mother"" and ""viviparous"" are considered obscenities of the worst degree. The ""Savages,"" who still hold more traditional ideals of marriage and family are objects of ridicule and contempt.The first part of the novel deals with the technology involved in this new world, while the second part details the exploits of John, a boy born of a World State mother while she is trapped in an Indian reservation. The moral conflict that John shows and the utter bewilderment of the World State denizens is striking. The idea that John's ideas of piety and pureness, ideas he ascertained from Shakespeare's works, are foreign and queer to the inhabitants of this new world. In fact, John is treated as a human oddity, yet he is easily the most human of all their inhabitants.This book is a satire, so it lacks of the riveting suspense and tension of ""1984."" In fact, from a worldly and pragmatic view, the World State isn't that terrible. Even when dissenters are found who threaten the stability of the World State, they are merely exiled to a remote island, a far cry from the fate that befalls dissenters in ""1984.""However, Brave New World still merits a read. It is entertaining and does show how de-humanizing the pursuit of worldly pleasures can be. The World State members are happy, but they are shallow shells of human beings who cannot think for themselves, love each other, or believe in a higher being.",book

1403,Ordered some takeout recently and I was not happy with my food. I ordered salmon with a side of rice.

1404,"Save us from historical revisionists like Ms. Takahashi, who clearly has no idea of the origins of the Mother Goose nursery rhymes or the harsh conditions that existed in England when the rhymes developed. Social class division, beating, and animal cruelty were facts of life. Certainly the subject matter can be a little grisly, but infants don't care -- they love the sing-song quality of the verses. Older children can find in the rhymes a painless introduction to history and a springboard for discussions about why we do things differently today. My grandmother used this book with my mother as an infant in 1922 and used it again with me as an infant in 1957. It is still just as good with our infant daughter today. Mother Goose has become a part of our cultural history. ""Updating"" the text to reflect modern mores smacks of the kind of historical revisionism carried out by Orwell's Ministry of Truth in ""1984.""",book

1412,"Every once in a while, a group of friends, with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm. Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and pals succeeded with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />Director Todd Sheets and his chums, however, are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if Zombie Bloodbath is anything to go by. A lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror, this miserable effort (about a plague of flesh-eating zombies¬ónatch) serves as a reminder that, whilst many people these days have access to a video camera, most shouldn't take that as their cue to try their hand at making a full-length movie.<br /><br />It's not that Sheets hasn't got an eye for a nicely framed shot (some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good), but rather that a) he has a lousy script b) he has a lousy cast, and c) he doesn't realise that he has a lousy script and cast. Which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme, and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film completists (like me) or members of the cast and crew (like those who have given the film favourable comments).<br /><br />Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at undiscriminating gore-hounds, and Sheets (who currently has an incredible 34 titles under his belt as a director) certainly goes out of his way to please, with buckets of offal and blood thrown about at every opportunity. But whilst these moments are undeniably yucky, they aren't particularly convincing, and soon get rather tedious.<br /><br />So, to summarise, this is a really bad film, with almost no redeeming features. Except for two:<br /><br />Firstly, it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film, as sported by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The magnificence of his barnet (coupled with a fetching moustache) is reason alone to watch this film.<br /><br />Secondly, it has 'pathetic stealth zombies': flesh-eating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by, before leaping from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack, which requires almost no effort to escape from. Best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it, 'pathetic stealth zombies' also occasionally hide behind low walls, or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation.<br /><br />Normally a film this bad would get 1/10 for me, but, in celebration of Jerry Angell's flowing locks, I will generously raise my rating to 2/10.",movie

Why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse **** a 10. You can say it's worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy you can't give it a 10 for comedy. You have to rate it on what it was supposed to actually be like and not for something the director wasn't intending. Maybe some of you voted 10 cause you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie have a high rating so that people would go out and rent or buy it cause you think it's fun to mislead people. You're playing with peoples time and money which you have no right to do. If the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but don't lie.

1415,"Six lectures delivered by Carlyle in 1840. He classifies six kinds of heroes: as Divinity (Wotan, paganism); Prophet (Mohamed); Poet (Dante, Shakespeare); Priest (Luther, Knox); Man of Letters (Johnson, Rousseau, Burns); and Ruler (Cromwell, Napoleon). The trait that defines a hero is: absolute sincerity and firm belief in his principles.In his highly rhetorical lectures, Carlyle highlights and reinforces the role of the individual in the social process, as opposed to the role of the masses. And he did that precisely when the foundations were being laid for the most influential &quot;pro-mass&quot; movement in History: Marxism. The tragedy of Marxism, at least one of them all, is that, when translated into action, the blind masses were also led by &quot;heroes&quot; of the most authocratic sort. Not properly the work of an historian, these lectures are vivid, inflamed and enthusiast. Their uselfuness for our present age is precisely that they remind us of the crucial role significant individuals play in history, to accelerate or slow down (and even reverse) the process of social change, which is usually more gradual, diffused, and diverse.",book
1416,"The entire Universe is contained in this book. So much pathos and so much wisdom have not been seen in an American novel since MOBY DICK. The intelligence brought to bear in Wolfe's understated and brilliantly layered book lies somewhere between Dickens and Joyce, with a little Shakespearean flair thrown in for good measure. Wolfe's primary topic here is memory and its effects (causality?) on human existence, and the shaping of human existence by story. Layered and interlocking stories relate the life of the narrator, and significantly, the stories merge together, the boundary between stories becoming increasingly blurred as the book winds down. It is, in essence, The Book of the Dead (and here is the significance of the title), telling the tales of the dead, so that they ultimately rest in Peace. It is not an easy read, but one which patient readers will treasure and hold dear--and reread incessantly--forever.",book

Having been forced to read this tripe under penalty of death in high school, and then once again in college, I must say that death is welcome. Oh poor poo-poo Heathcliff the Brooding and Catherine the ill fated strumpet. Yawn. Emily Bronte lived one of those lives like that of the other Emily, you know, Dickenson, who is another pile of rubbish altogether. Lonely days and cold nights with her father, and no hot little encounters with a horny gardener from Spain. All Emily Bronte needed was a good tango, but I fear that she was too chaste. And so the world must bear the weight of this tragedy, of its endless reprints which will mark the end of Time. Of course you can love this book and curl up with it at night as if it were your secret lover, or teddy bear, (Even if your teddy bear is your secret lover.) and listen to that song by Michael Penn, or whoever wrote that piece of yack.

1423,"Here's yet another film from the 80's that most people just don't know exists. This slow, picturesque (the loving shots of the Montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of Costner's recent ""Open Range"", which also starred Robert Duval), and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you can't sleep or on a listless Sunday afternoon. Those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting. The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Duval, and Wilford Brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals, as are all the supporting players and young actors. I especially liked how director Cain (who unfortunately hasn't directed anything of note since this except the first ""Young Guns"") gives us quiet little glimpses into everyone's personal grief. We don't just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents, but also the confused middle sister, the wayward uncle, his crazy wife, and the dead teenager's girlfriend. What we essentially get here is the rural Mid-Western answer to ""Ordinary People."" There's also shades of David Lynch's ""The Straight Story"" in some of the stoic downhome Mid-West morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit. This is one of the better and more realistic ""tear-jerkers"" of the era, and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there.",movie

1426,"I don't like Sean Penn's directing very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The movie has no core, it's colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell's Angels greetings, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is dead meaningless, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap.",movie

1429,"&quot;Singular Images&quot; is a delightfully simple photographic exploration of Ireland made by young Donovan Wylie. His pictures are graceful and poetic, yet they have a definite solidity about them...an air that is quite of the essence of the Magnum Photo Agency, of which he is a part. At the early age of 16, he made the pictures in this book; pictures that many seasoned professionals would trip over themselves trying to create. This body of Wylie's work has a sense of innocence, and it's apparent through these marvelous photographs. The photographs themselves have a definite &quot;street&quot; feel. His wanderings take him all over the place, but his pictures have a beautiful coherency. They are merely gritty, black and white documents of his travels. One thing is for sure, this Gen-X photographer has a bright future ahead of him. At the age of 21, he was made a nominee of the Magnum Photo Agency, then an associate member two years later. In many ways, he is the future of what Magnum will be.

1437,"Starship Troopers (1959) is the thirteenth SF novel in the Juvenile series, followingHave Spacesuit - Will Travel. This story was almost not published. Scribner had published the previous twelve books, but rejected this story. It was eventually published by G.P. Putnam's Sons.This story takes place in a future time after an unspecified disaster. The previous government was gone, so veterans of the various conflicts that occurred during this time formed their own government. Only veterans need apply for citizenship; the meek and unblooded who had not risked their lives for their fellows were not allowed to vote or serve in public office.In this novel, Juan (Johnny) Rico is a young man growing up within this new milieu. He attends the required History and Moral Philosophy classes to learn to be a citizen. Much of the book dwells on the discussions within this classroom.Carl is Johnny's best friend throughout high school. But he has been the brains and Johnny the brawn.Carmencita Ibanez is a classmate of Johnny and Carl. She never has trouble getting dates, but she doesn't go out with the same bay twice in a row. She does well in mathematics and has great reflexes. She often uses the Rico family pool to keep in shape.In this story, Carl decides to join the military to earn his citizenship. Naturally, Johnny immediately declares that he has the same intentions. Yet Carl doesn't think that Johnny's father will let him join.Legally, his father cannot prevent him from joining up. When Johnny brings up the subject, his father disparages the whole idea and then offers a trip to Mars after graduation. Johnny is very happy until he tries to tell Carl that he has other plans.On the way to the recruiting office, Johnny and Carl meet Carmencita. She tells them that she is applying for pilot training. The boys think that she would be a great pilot with all her talents and skills.Then Johnny joins the military, but all his choices for branch assignment are eliminated by his test scores and interviews. He is assigned to the Mobile Infantry, the default branch. Although he is disappointed, he unhesitatingly defends the branch after his temporary roommate belittles it.This tale operates on two levels. The History and Moral Philosophy parts discuss some of the basic issues about military service. At the same time, Johnny is finding out the hard facts of life and death while fighting against an enemy.Although this work has been called a militaristic fantasy, it is actually a cautionary tale. Read the scene about ""violence doesn't solve anything"" and then ask the Carthaginians about that concept, if you can find any. Remember, it takes two sides to fight a war, but only one side to commit a massacre; maybe the Amerindians, the Jews, the Kulaks and other slaughtered people would have an opinion on this subject.There are certain truths that are self-evident, including the fact that humans -- as presently constituted -- are fighting animals. Moreover, the author postulates that alien creatures resemble humans in that respect, if no other. Furthermore, governments are necessary to prevent internal tyranny, but have a tendency to change over time into such tyrannies.This type of government is not new. Many governments have required all male citizens to serve in the military and revolts have usually left the troops in charge. However, the author takes artistic license to allow the new government to grow into a limited democracy much like that of Athens. Yet citizenship is available to ANY person who is willing to put his life in danger for his fellow man.The author bypasses the common trend of such a governments -- such as revolutionary France and South America -- to degenerate into military dictatorships. Somehow, this government continued to be a limited democracy with upward mobility.As the author says in the book, the only thing that can be claimed for this government is that it works. Any government can be viable, but the dictatorial governments invest large amounts of effort keeping its population from revolting. Many governments ensure that any persons who are likely to revolt has a chance to work off their anger against an external enemy.This method has worked many times in the past, but has one flaw: veterans come home with many skills needed by revolutionaries. So the author gives them control of their own society. In that respect, the historical parallel is probably Sparta.One aspect of this novel that is not mentioned very often is the common experiences of military personnel. Anyone who has served in any branch of the military during combat has at least a vague understanding of the limitations and uncertainties of military force. When leaders know these limitations, they are very unlikely to put their domains into unnecessary conflicts.This novel is a classic of science fiction. Despite all the other excellent works by the author, this one tends to stick in the reader's memory for decades. Read and enjoy!Highly recommended for Heinlein fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of moral philosophy, armed combat, and comradeship.-Arthur W. Jordin",book

1440,"A deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe: An impoverished Giovanna has ended up in the gutter, but still has an ace up her sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, a fat-bellied gas station tenant, who has been getting on in years, picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection. But the physical contact that Giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust, and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of.<br /><br />The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally provides her the longed-for opportunity. And you don't have to ask her twice: At the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired, and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance.<br /><br />The developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by Giovanna though. Gino's yearning for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the place with Giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside. Giovanna aims at another goal: to get Bragana killed, to inherit and, in addition to that, to collect the insurance premium. In her hands Gino degenerates into a self-sacrificing tool. Being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold-blooded killer.<br /><br />But in contrast to Giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level. The very taking over of Bragana's place, which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man, causes a deep loathing of himself. And later, after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through Giovanna's cunningly devised plan, he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute.<br /><br />If Visconti's film ended at this point, it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool, calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. But then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse. At last Giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done, and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew Gino's love. Her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate. It also affects us, while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster. The culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start.<br /><br />",movie
1441,"""El Mar"" directed by Catalonian director Agusti Villarona, and based on the novel by Blai Bonet, offers a glimpse of the Spanish history as seen by a Balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country. The movie concentrates on three friends, and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in Majorca, to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium, lost in the countryside.<br /><br />We first meet three boys that are playing happily. Not everything is what it seems. The tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed. The boys have excluded a young girl, about their age, from taking part in their games.<br /><br />When we meet the adult Ramallo again, he is on his way to a sanatorium. He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, Manuel Tur, one of his boyhood friends is also being treated, and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care. It is obvious that Tur looks at Ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences.<br /><br />Roger Casamajor does a good job with portraying the older Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino makes an impression as Tur, the vulnerable youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina, puts an appearance as Carmen, the wife of the caretaker of the institution. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara.<br /><br />""El Mar"" is a dark film that clearly shows Agusti Villarona's talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer.",movie

1443,"Stay Alive is a bland horror movie about a video game that kills people the same way they die inside the game. The friends that play this game soon figure this out, and then realise they must defeat the Blood Countess from the video game or accept their fates. We've had video tapes in The Ring, a deadly website in FearDotCom. Now it's onto video games. Stay Alive does some things well; the character development is quite a bit deeper than it usually would be in a horror movie. We really see into some of the characters feelings and past and get to know them all quite well, so the audience may gain some emotions for them. The film is also very suspenseful. Tense, unnerving moments are frequently played through the film, accompanied by unsettling, creepy music. There are plenty of jumps and jolts for the viewer. This can be ideal once or twice, but these false scares that Hollywood seems to enjoy overplaying in horror films nowadays, wears thin in Stay Alive. The camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes in order to give viewers a very quick glimpse of a demon or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden burst on the screen. Why? The gore is obviously very weak because of the film's certificate. The script to Stay Alive is very cheesy and quite laughable, and the characters tend to play it too melodramatically and confusingly. Also, clich√©s come in from every direction, for instance people wandering around on their own in search of a strange noise or if they have spotted a figure in the dark, they will go and investigate it. However the computer graphics used for the video game segments are rather impressive and look colourful and sharp, working well with the other parts of the film. But overall, there is just not enough to hold out on with this film. Stretching at just over a hundred minutes, it won't be a battle to Stay Alive, but rather, Stay Awake.",movie

1447,"but it's worth watching for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's entertainments that were filmed during the war either required transplanting to American shores, as in This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles where they did not fit. Bacall fits that part here. I kept waiting for her to whistle and bring Bogie to life; her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class Englishwoman. But listen to the dialogue! No, people don't talk that way except in books, but Greene was sending a message about an England that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world. One other positive note: Greene's range of characters were kept whole. While Mr. Mukerjee resembled more a Brahamin, at least his nationality was kept, and his final conversation with Paxinou is priceless.",movie

1451,"There seems to be a debate whether these books are appropriate for young children. This is my first Junie B. book (I had been reluctant to try them due to the debate). While I see both sides, I come down squarely in favor of them, if they are read with a parent or teacher. First, they are very 'real' -- Junie B. talks and thinks like a real six-year-old. Second, they are very, very funny -- for children and adults. Third, they provide teaching moments for the adult to discuss Junie's conduct and feelings -- and by extension the child's feelings. (I used this story as a vehicle to discuss my four-year-old's frustration with her two-year-old brother's conduct.) But there are some downsides. First, the grammar is too 'real' -- it is how real six-year-olds talk. Since I am reading to my four-year-old, I edit the text as I read to clean up some of the grammar. Even if I did not, my daughter's grammar is not going to be harmed by Junie B. Second, Junie B. is not a model six-year-old -- and who is? Nevertheless, an adult should discuss with the child times when Junie B. acts inappropriately. My daughter and I also read Magic TreehouseMagic Tree House Series Books: Night of the Ninjas / Dolphins At Daybreak / Polar Bears Past Bedtime / Tonight on the Titanic / Magic Tree House Research Guide: Rain Forests (Unboxed Set of MARY POPE OSBORNE Magic TreeHouse Books, # 5, 9, 12, 17 + 1 Research Guide) and Geronimo StiltonThe Curse of the Cheese Pyramid (Geronimo Stilton, No. 2)books.

1460,"'The Vampire Bat' is definitely of interest, being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930's, but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise.<br /><br />The film is set in a European village sometime in the 19th Century, where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals. There is a very similar feel to James Whale's 'Frankenstein' and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill's Dr Niemann character, complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement.<br /><br />The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton Herman (Dwight Frye), thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one.<br /><br />This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred (also 'Doctor X' and 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum') and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements. Taken in context though, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and derivative.<br /><br />All we are left with is a poor-quality Frankenstein imitation, with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans. But for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer was doing the 'Blondie' films a few years later.",movie
1461,"Once again I must play something of the contrarian. Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a ""C"" letter grade from me.<br /><br />It seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors: One, that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood film, and two, that it is trying to do things differently.<br /><br />The first point I couldn't care less about. I'm not looking for realism in films, and so I do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how I believe the real world to be--I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, and so on, although I do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist.<br /><br />For the second point, I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However, I don't think ""originality"" versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself. A film can be ""original"" and poor, just like a film can be formulaic and excellent. What matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer.<br /><br />Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai cop named Daya Naik. Naik was an ""encounter specialist"". Encounter specialists, who could be said to be early instantiations of real world ""Judge Dredds"", are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue, and they're basically given a license to kill--effectively acting as policeman, judge, jury and executioner in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the encounter specialist based on Naik. We see him at work, interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence. We see him at home, trying to live a normal life in his less-than-luxurious surroundings. We see him trying to adjust to a new ""commissioner"" halfway through the film. And we see his odd relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare).<br /><br />All of this has the potential to make a fabulous, gritty film. I agree that it's nice to forgo the typical Bollywood musical numbers and romances--not every film needs that stuff; Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced. Additionally, Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances--Patekar almost gives off a Death Wish (1974)-era Charles Bronson vibe. It also has admirable cinematography--the hand-held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective, for example. It has a great score that mixes more of a moody Hollywood-sounding action/crime score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is well done and gritty.<br /><br />There is also decent exploration of subtexts, including the morality of (having) encounter specialists, the idea of following orders, and so on. The encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong. More poignantly, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and, say, members of a country's military, and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to.<br /><br />But (you just knew there was a ""But"" coming, didn't you?) director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters, far too much sprawl, and that moves a bit too slow. All of these problems may be due to Amin and crew looking at the Godfather films, which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) resemblances to, although from a policeman's perspective.<br /><br />Most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well--these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least, except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For one, Narayan, I didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film. His name is mentioned a number of times, but I'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change. Then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and I'd have to start all over figuring out who Narayan was.<br /><br />The same thing happened with Agashe's first commissioner. The film was already far into the new commissioner before I could figure out the relationships. It seems like there are new characters in every scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. While that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about (because they're mostly doing so on orders), since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists, either, it's difficult to find characters to care about, and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film.<br /><br />The primary villain is Zameer. But until about halfway through the film, there's no indication of this. He doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film, and he's literally ""phoning his performance in""--he's in another location (Dubai), communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film. We don't actually see Zameer doing much. To an extent, the film depends on a couple ""twists"" that necessitate not showing Zameer doing a number of things, but we could see him do other things, and a lot of the other villains could have been left out.<br /><br />That would have tightened up the film a bit, making it more focused and about a half-hour shorter, both of which would have benefited its impact. This is not an action-packed film by any means. For at least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style, but saying, ""Okay, get on with the story already"".",movie

1469,"This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located right alongside the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term in itself for tidal wave). Naturally, this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture, what with Hollywood having a field day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and more recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.<br /><br />But I'll have to say this: The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned earlier, look like classics. This disaster movie IS a disaster, and a massive one at that. Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage, and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime.<br /><br />The special effects are gorgeous to look at. From satellite styled outer space pictures, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain bores.<br /><br />If you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a God-like mode. Things happen just like that on screen, with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. It's akin to Godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. Morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.<br /><br />Trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. These are characters that you don't give a hoot about.<br /><br />If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. And infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.<br /><br />Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.",movie
1470,"Made in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai was one of the big films made by Welles after returning from relative exile for making Citizen Kane. Dark, brooding and expressing some early Cold War paranoia, this film stands tall as a Film-Noir crime film. The cinematography of this film is filled with Welles' characteristic quirks of odd angles, quick cuts, long pans and sinister lighting. The use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening shot in Touch of Evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and the sequences in Chinatown can only be considered as the inspiration, in many ways, to Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, it is Welles' obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety. The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques.<br /><br />However, despite this criticism, the story combined with wonderful performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) make this film a joy to watch. Orson Welles pulls off not only the Irish brogue, but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time, breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions. Finally, Glenn Anders strange and bizarre portrayal or Elsa's husbands' law partner is nothing short of classic!",movie

1476,"""Rois et Reine"" is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights. It focuses by turns on ex-lovers Nora (Emanuelle Devos)and Ismael (Mathieu Amalric) as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives. While Nora's story is played straight and is sombre in tone, Ismael's is played mainly for laughs, although it's not particularly funny. Nora's crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father Louis (Maurice Garrel), and Ismael's by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party. Ismael and Louis are just two of the males who have shaped Nora's life, and in turn have been shaped by her, the most notable others being her now deceased first lover Pierre and their young son Elias. As events past and present are played out for the audience, and the ex-lovers become involved in each other's lives once more, it gradually emerges that Nora's personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye.<br /><br />Cult director Arnaud Desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here, one which has garnered major plaudits in France. He wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone. Had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked, but it's not clear in the end what exactly Desplechin's film is actually about. Heavy-handed allusions to Greek mythology and Freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but, at least for this unschooled movie-goer, remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters. At other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne ""Moon River"" as the film's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate.<br /><br />**Spoiler alert** I suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us. This idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of Pierre and the revelation contained in Louis' secret diary, but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of Pierre and Louis' respective relationships with Nora. This seems a cheat on Desplechin's part, as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative. One or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare, but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film-making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story. In fact, for all its heavy-handed hints at depth, the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced, as if they function more as ciphers for their creator's many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right. Much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic. For example, Ismael, as we are constantly reminded, is a viola player, but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play, and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated. Hence, he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist. <br /><br />Amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane Ismael, but I found Devos cloying and monotone (which may be intentional, however) as the elusive Nora. Meanwhile Jean-Paul Roussillon as Ismael's father, Elsa Wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and Magalie Woch as the psychically wounded but defiant Sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors. Catherine Deneuve's in it, too, though her role is little more than a self-referential cameo.<br /><br />Ultimately, ""Rois et Reine"" is very much an acquired taste. Should it fail to push your buttons, it's very likely that Desplechin's undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching.",movie

This book makes you sad and happy and discouraged and uplifted all in one sentence.

In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart-like writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles--in fact, she has no family at all. Well, like Rock, she is maneuvered into performing--in this case, creating a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside.

1486,"He starts out with a story about a college ministry that had a couple of students who were sleeping together (unmarried). When the campus minister approaches them with scripture verses that condemn their behavior, their response was ""that's your interpretation""....hoping this stuns his readers (I'm not sure it stuns as many today as it would have 10 years ago)...he goes on to establish his premise that the bible is not a book with things for us to draw out of it whatever we feel is good for us....but rather a book that actually teaches certain things which comprise truth. From there he logically expands to cover a wide array of topics sequencing through the various issues of what Bible Scholars call 'Hermeneutics'. Biblical Hermeneutics is the art of interpreting scripture correctly.I find his writing style to be inviting, concise, to the point and well organized. It's a really good book...on a subject that is not as easy to write about as it may first appear.This book is a good primer for lay leaders as well as college students who are being introduced to the topic for the first time. We are using it to prepare our church leaders for an upcoming seminar on hermeneutics.One of the things I like about this textbook is that it covers the historyof interpretation in a short period of time (pp 79-118), so the new student can come up to speed on what the history of interpretation has been in crucial time periods of Christianity. For example he focuses on Luther/Calvin hermeneutics and then modernity hermeneutics after that. He covers all the 'turning points' historically of hermeneutics. The quick overview is a really good primer for newbies in biblical hermeneutics.For a busy pastor/bible teacher who has not had much or has forgotten their hermeneutics training...this book gives you a relatively easy read without sacrificing crucial elements. It will refresh you on the key elements of hermeneutics. If you are studying hermeneutics right now, and your course doesn't use this book, it is a good one to add for additional research or reading.Five star...you really ought to add this one to your library.",book
1487,"There are other reviews here expressing similar views, but I still feel impelled to add my comments. The film is generally well-made from a technical point of view, apart from possibly being too long. The acting is mostly very good, although Kevin Spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition rather than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only function seems to be as eye candy, which she admittedly manages very well.<br /><br />At a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism, and I get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. However, it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew (I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much of that is down to Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice. Aside from the fact that I don't agree with that position, I don't think that such a view actually helps the anti-racist cause at all - it's more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. At the end the prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end the message seems to be that it's OK to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. It's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt, which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case.<br /><br />Samuel L Jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately this also undermines the plot - he comes across as someone with considerable integrity, but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea (and indeed he doesn't, when push comes to shove). We're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty, but in fact at one point he's offered a plea of manslaughter, although if you blink you might miss it. Why not take it, given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim? Or if he wants to make a stand in court, why plead insanity?<br /><br />There are less serious flaws too. The medical experts, on whose testimony the case supposedly rests, are jokes - both are discredited for highly implausible reasons, and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say, and shouldn't be believed. The fact that the injured policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit convenient (and what if he had died?) I find it hard to believe that the KKK would march down the street in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrous.<br /><br />My final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty - as though I must be a racist because I disagree with the resolution. It may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide, but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end. The film did make me think about my views, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion, so at some level maybe it succeeded - but I worry that it may have re-inforced highly illiberal views in some people, which I hope is the opposite of what it intended.<br /><br />Final thought - try watching Law and Order, it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!",movie

1491,"Last October I was fortunate enough to be golfing Bandon Dunes Golf Course in Southern Oregon for several days. You golf right on the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean. The scenery is breathtaking. For any avid hacker, it's a golfer's paradise. Anyway, I had a 69 year old caddy who carried my golf bag (which I swear has a couple of bowling balls hidden in it somewhere.....it weighs a ton), up and down the hilly grounds of the golf course all day long without breaking a sweat......how'd he do that?!? At the end 18 holes, I was ready to plop down and have a brewski with the guys and ease my aching bones, while my 69 year old caddy was off to meet another golfer and pack that player's clubs another 18 hilly holes before his day was done. Anyway, he was a terrific gentleman and he loved to read. While we cruised the courses over a couple of days we resolved a lot of the worlds problems, and talked a lot about our favorite books. He said that I just absolutely had to read this novel as he felt it was his favorite book of all time. He was a huge Steinbeck fan. Soooo......I read this book because he said that I should, and I thank him for the recommendation.I've never read a Steinbeck novel before, even though I know he's considered one of the great American writers of all time. It's hard to believe this book was first published 45 years ago.....it's hard to believe how fast the time goes by. The difference in the writing style and the language used by the author compared to the verbal dreck that most authors get away with today is very evident. Steinbeck's vocabulary and use of words reminded me of the kinds of books that we were all forced to read when I was a student back in the dark ages.Basically, the book is a travelogue of Steinbeck's journey across America in a pickup truck and camper. He has his trusted companion ""Charlie"" (who is a full-sized poodle) sitting beside him throughout his several month's journey. Steinbeck made this trek because he wanted to know what America really was, rather than the pre-conceived notions he'd already had in mind. He found that there is no way to really describe our country in a specific way because of how vast and different each region of the country is. I think it took a lot out of him emotionally as he faced prejudice, witnessed racism in the South, the ratrace of the cities, and the virtues of small town values. Just as most of us tend to define the French or the English or any other nation with a specific identity and preconceived notions, I think Steinbeck had also hoped to define America and it's people in a specific, generic way, but I think that through his travels he found this country too complex and diverse to simply give a general definition for what a 'typical' American is. He found that there really isn't any such thing as a 'typical' American. I think he was probably worn out and frustrated at the end of his trip because he was not able to reach many conclusions that he had probably anticipated answering prior to his leaving.So anyway, he traveled across the country with Charlie, seeing old friends and making new ones. He visited his home town and found out that he could never really go home again.....things change, and people and places are never really quite like you remember them. Steinbeck was really quite a wild man, and he loved having his drink most anytime that he could get away with it. I loved his observations about life and the people around us. It was amazing how so many of today's problems were also yesterday's problems. It was fun to read a classic author again. I can't say this would be everybody's cup of tea, but I surely enjoyed most of the book.Bottom Line, I give the book a solid 4 Stars.",book

1494,"This is by far one of the very best books I have ever read. Nora Roberts certainly shows her talents as a writer with the character of Emma McAvoy taking the reader through a life-long journey of ups and downs in the pop music world. This story takes place over a 20+ year span as we meet little Emma, not quite 3 years old about to be rescued from her drug and alcohol-dependent mother by a father she has never met. We watch Emma grow amidst the money and madness of a Beatle-like group, her father, Brian, the lead with the other members of the band, Stevie, P.M., and Johonno (each with their own set of issues) taking on the role of surrogate fathers. Emma dreams of living ""her"" life, minus the security and bodyguards, only to find that there are people out there willing to kill to keep her from remembering a deep, dark secret buried within her soul. People like Drew Latimer, only wanting to be close to Emma to get to her father, were many. She needed to find the life she deserved with a man who would love her for herself and not because she was Brian McAvoy's daughter. Michael Kesserling seems to be just that man, however, there are many problems and mysteries to be solved within Emma herself before she can begin to live the life she so fully deserves. Without revealing the plot, I can only say that ""Public Secrets"" is a book no one should miss. It is Nora in her early years (1990) and definitely at her best!",book

THE HYPE IS REAL. WORTH THE WAIT. I was solo dining so the wait time was shorter than normal (~30 minutes) + I went during a weekday. I was quickly seated by the bar and noticed the restaurant was completely packed! No open seats. They are busy for a reason. It's THE best brunch spot in Portland!

Although this book is not comparable to Year of the Dragon, and amazing book he published in 1981 (the movie wasn't so amazing, however) it was his first foray into the Holocaust. Although this book provides much excitement, it lacks what is most important in any War novel... pace.

Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie.

It's also marvelous because it has the depth and feel of a trilogy or a series but is still a single novel. The descriptions and intrigue are wonderful. Perhaps, due to a sense of today's loss of deep values, I don't understand some of the drama in the book.

1513,"I used ""An Invitation to Chess"" when I taught a grade school course in chess fundamentals. Of all the chess books I have seen geared purely toward the beginner, I found this to be the clearest, best organized, and, just as the subtitle claims, it is ""A Picture Guide to The Royal Game.""Lots of pictures help explain the moves and motions of a piece in the context of a larger strategy. Chernev and Harkness used photos of the board as well as standard board drawings. They require modernized, as the photos are a bit blurry, and the drawings have an old newspaper keyline look. The copy is succinct, but not dry. As a reader, I found it less clinical than many of the chess books with dozens of lines per opening.This is a long way from anything Lasker or Fischer wrote, but the audience intended here is looking to play the game effectively, unworried about becoming a grandmaster. At least, not yet.The content list breaks things down to subsections like ""How the King Moves and Captures,"" and ""How the Pawn Captures 'en passant.''"" They provide a special section cautioning the new player of common mistakes, like ""Premature Attacks,"" and ""Pawn Grabbing with the Queen."" This is invaluable because young players routinely shoot for point control over game control.I fully recommend ""An Invitation to Chess"" by Irving Chernev and Kenneth Harkness. Use this to teach your children, or use it to study up when they start to beat you.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com",book

A big problem for someone who doesn't own a microwave. Last week I tried ordering a turkey sandwich instead. When I arrived 25 minutes later, they hadn't even seen that an order had come through. They threw a sandwich together quickly, but the meat was worse than what you get at subway. Dry and flavorless.

Went to other Brazilian steakhouses and they bring breaded fried bananas,  cassava, rice, ""farofa"", provolone cheese, and other appetizers to the table,  but this restaurant didn't do that.

Nothing on the walls, no Naruto fan gear, no theme song/naruto intros...naruto ain't even on the TV here. We went as a group super excited only to be let down. The food looks super bomb but we had to ask for all kinds of seasoning to get it above the F it was about to earn. Overall, I can't give it more than two stars.

The evil creature is unleashed, kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family for revenge.<br /><br />The cheesy ""Jack-O"" is a combination of a terrible story with awful acting. I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie, showing a total lack of respect with the name of this great actor. It is impressive how bad the acting is, shifting the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is the type of movie good to see with a group of friends, drinking beer, making comments and laughing a lot.

1521,"""Sex and the City"" has some great things going for it. The problem is that it's saddled with a number of negatives that really hurt the ultimate rating and review for its' six seasons.<br /><br />The good things about ""SATC"" is that a lot of the conversations ring true to life, the romance stories are interesting, and the characters are fun.<br /><br />The bad things is that few women act like complete whores. These four women have so many partners, even going lesbian in some episodes, that you have no choice but to roll your eyes at the utter absurdity. Men on the show are for the most part depicted as shallow, degenerates, liars, cheats, and buffoons. The foul language these women use is far in excess as to what a normal conversation entails. Why do the writers do these things? Clearly, to be over-the-top and to get your attention.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me (without spoiling) is how some of the relationships ended. They simply didn't ring real to me or to others I discussed this with.<br /><br />But, even though I gave the show 2 stars, in the end, I'm glad I watched the show. I've actually watched every season multiple times. I do recommend the show to anyone that won't be offended by strong profanity and soft-core pornography. I could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sex acts but the romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well.",movie

Heck, they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family. Although, when you finally do get to see the monsters completely, you really think ""WTF!? those itty bitty things are after them?!"" The only part that really disturbed me is when *sniff* they killed the kitty! Not the kitty, noooooo, why? Seriously though, if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore, this is not the movie for you. Go rent The Hills Have Eyes or something along those lines.

This book has a wrong title in my opinion. Although it does cover the ""love"" part of each one of us, this book is much more than that. It allows the reader to learn about himself/herself, and that's how books like this should be used for anyways. Very interesting reading, and the ""shadow"" sections on each one of the signs is of great insight because all shadows are related to aspects of our personality that we don't recognize and don't accept.

1528,"Several years ago, someone introduced me to The Urantia Book. I had intended to read the entire 2000 plus pages of it, but never did as it was just too much. Recently, I ran into this book made up of ""a collection of key passages from The Urantia Book"" compiled by Kelly Elstrott. At 300 or so pages, it contains mostly passages from The Urantia Book and some brief commentary. This sounded like a way to get a flavor of the whole book in a lot less time, so I gave it a try.Much of what I read really spoke to me. Maybe it will to you too. I would recommend trying this shorter version if 2000 pages seems like a lot.There is some controversy over the source of the Urantia materials. I don't claim to understand all the hoopla and think it not necessary to go there. Here's one of my reasons for feeling this way, quoting from page 303 of The Fifth Revelation:""Like all other sacred texts, the contents should not be evaluated by relying on claims of authorship or authority, but rather upon the 'fruits of the spirit' which they produce. The new reader might explore the book as a fascinating piece of religious literature until such time as it spiritual quality authenticates its message and its source."" This is really similar (if you look closely at least) to Matthew 7:15-20 if you prefer a biblical source:""Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits.""As I said, much of what I read in The Fifth Revelation really spoke to me, so I think there is something to this. I didn't see anything dangerous in it.Will I now read The Urantia Book? Maybe some day, but I have many other things I want to read first, and it takes a long time to get through 2000 pages.I should mention that I came across another (shorter) book based on The Urantia Book called, The Center Within: Lessons from the Heart of the Urantia Revolution by Belitsos and Harris. It is 290 pages and has quotes and lots of commentary. I did not like it as much as this one - see my review of it for details.One thing I found interesting was that Mr. Elstrott (the author/compiler here) is a chemical engineer from Louisiana. So am I. Not a group known for being spiritually adventurous. Just goes to show how wrong stereotypes can be.",book

1533,"When it comes to horror movies, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore sub-par production values, and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare. This movies simply has no good scares to offer. It can't even be enjoyed as camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, the kills were predictable and poorly staged, the music was annoying, the camera work was wretched, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who were obviously trying, but who had to deal with terrible, contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they got any rehearsal, either. It's embarrassing to watch, and so boring than making it through to the contrived ""surprise"" ending requires tremendous endurance. It's quite easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />I don't normally write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you must watch this movie, don't miss the ""Making of""-featurette. The writer/director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold, daring move. (Seen it.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it's a new-age ""Citizen Kane."" It's like listening to a group of third-graders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant. They truly think they've created something of substance. It's sad, really¬Ö The only reason I gave this movie a ""2"" is because I think ""1"" should be reserved for true atrocities, like ""Manos: Hands of Fate"" and ""Space Mutiny."" So ""American Nightmare"" isn't the WORST movie I've ever seen, but I'd have to say that it's somewhere in the bottom fifty.",movie

'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, which he produced. His latest outing as a filmmaker 'London Dreams' comes up as his careers weakest fare.<br /><br />'London Dreams' has a mediocre storyline, it's about how success turns friendship into hatred. Agreed, it has the potential but when you watch 'London Dreams' you wonder what's happening? This film has maybe the worst climax in recent times. Vipul Shah the writer puts Vipul Shah the director down. <br /><br />The first hour is boring, The second hour is better; but again the climax is horrendous. How can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you? I won't. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reaches India, rather than slapping or abusing him Salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco?

Write what you feel, don't fool us {the audience}, we are sensible enough to understand what's good or not. <br /><br />This is a musical but the music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible.

1551,"where would one start a review of the film Snitch'd? James Cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since Encino Man. his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop McClure, which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor! said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking, and discovers a gang war to rival that of Police Academy 1, and i mean the one where Jones is racially vilified by his new partner, but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will EVER HEAR.<br /><br />Cahill's grasp of effects, both visual and aural is electrifying, the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch'd, a real gritty like underground thriller. also, kudos to his brilliant use of makeup, such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue! YUCK! i feel the world of film is much less from James' passing, his memory will linger on and on and on, reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, Snitch'd. his insightful director's commentary released a coke-hit up the nose of any discerning film goer, truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets, captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl.<br /><br />but i ask you, why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap? i'll tell you why, because thats life in Santa Ana baby, its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle's offices, oh no. there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft, tattooed underbelly of street life in LA to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a School For Special Children's production of Double Dragon: The Play.<br /><br />the only qualm i have with this film, is that there was never a sequel made. come on Steven Spielberg, come on George Lucas, come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23, how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man, James Cahill.<br /><br />he discovered Eva Longoria you know. oh yeah, that he did.<br /><br />Jonah",movie

1557,"Visually, this film is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way, together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles, that had my hopes up at the start, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, no matter how much spectacle is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world. Active around the start of the 20th century, Fish's life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age. This film is based upon two tracks: Fish's life and that of William F. King, lead investigator of the case. What saves this film from becoming a Hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort, whenever films about serial killers are concerned, is the direction, which is a double-edged sword; director Scott L. Flynn sheds focus enough upon the b-actors not to let their flaws shine through too much, but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the American police through the King-angle. Sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with Fish's meet with Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl that he killed, even though I'm not really sure if her mother was the media-crazed person that Flynn really tries to emphasise that she was. I miss more psychological diving into Fish, not to mention the very little time which was spent on Fish's post-capture. All in all, interesting for those who are into serial-killers, but mostly a let-down; however, if the director will make another film about another serial-killer, I'd definitely see it in hopes that holes were patched-up.",movie

'Cuss it's even dumber than the dumb people who watch it. There are no jokes, only half-jokes and slight gags that barely even warrant a tiny internal smile. The acting is your typical, unsubtle, idiotic, standard sitcom flailing-limbs type acting. And why oh why did this crap replace arrested development? Well you gotta hand it to Fox. They know that they need to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers. You see, the reason Arrested Development wasn't massively popular was because it was so smart. It was so smart that it made dumb people feel bad about being so dumb. And of course, if a dumb person encounters a smart person, the dumb person will hate the smart person. Most of the time anyway. Either that, or try and mooch off of the smart person. If you like this show, and are one of the dumb people, I truly cannot fathom what it must be like not to have open eyes and open minds. I cannot fathom what it must be like to be mindless, laughing drones, influenced by every little thing. Basically, people who laugh with a laugh track are parrots.

1561,"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the web site states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition money, Bartleby must make his fake college into a functioning one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules, and party all night.<br /><br />(My Comment) The premise of starting a college without a teaching staff is a little off the wall. Since it was a fake college, Bartleby really didn't need a staff. The movie reminded me of the classic movie ""Animal House"", the college setting, the fraternity, lots of gags, and pretty young women. These new college freshmen had a different notion of what the college experience was all about. The movie not only has lots of humor, it also has a good message for life. People should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The ending was a little unrealistic, but it is only a movie. The movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)",movie

I looked over some photos and it all looked SO GOOD, so I just got in the car without finishing looking at all the pictures and went!  I do that a lot. I've got time, and my hybrid car gets really good mileage so off I go.

      I ordered the kebabs. The nice and helpful young lady asked beef or chicken. I asked can you do 1 of each, sure!  

     The kebabs were rather hard and very dry. I mean really really dry. I had only taken a fork as normally one doesnt need a knife and had to get up to get a knife as a fork would not cut through!  My guess is that they were not even cooked today. Ive had kebabs in the middle east, and all over the world.  Generally you cant go wrong. These though were the worst ever.

   Then I thought lets try something else. The young lady suggested a pizza. I thought ok...maybe thats a safe bet. It was better than the kebabs. It was cooked fresh and served hot. It was thin,watery, and dripped a lot, most likely from the large pieces of tomato. Would be nice to have some sort of spinkel stuff for the pizza like chili flakes, grated cheese, dry herbs, but no such items in sight for a place that serves pizza. 

    I was offered a taste of the kuba by another yelper who just happened to be at the next table. It was new to me, but didnt appeal much. It was also dry.

Miku Rolls - salmon, snow crab, and cucumber rolls. You can taste the freshness of the salmon and snow crab all in one bite. 

Salmon Oshi Sushi - signature dish. This was perfect. Thin cuts of salmon were layered between rice. The top was seared with a special sauce. The sushi melts in your mouth! 

Saba Oshi Sushi - cured mackerel with miso sauce. We were warned to not get this if we didn't like the smell of mackerel. The flavor was really strong but we liked it nonetheless!

From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful.&quot;Stolen Moments &quot; which is reminiscent of &quot;Love Story&quot; is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry.

So, I've hung out with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc. but this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction. Our first meeting went well, she does a superb job playing the frightened/cagey Elsa, married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run away with her, she doesn't know if she can live without the things money can buy. Elsa, her husband, and his partner bicker and bite, just like the sharks Mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true. Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house. (Think the ending shootout in The Man with the Golden Gun, which borrowed heavily from this scene). I wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end.<br /><br />This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish centers on the sea, it is subtle, sour, and pungent, all to great effect. These might not be the best, fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco.

This book is not a how-to start a business and take it public kind of book, but rather a look at the woman who ended up doing precisely that and what it meant to her personally.It's interesting to read the other reviews, because obviously some readers wanted Rebecca to say that she had done it all on her own without any support from her family, or that she managed to create a multi-million dollar business, have a family, AND have time for hobbies, friends, and handicrafts. But the fact that Rebecca's husband and parents worked beside her doesn't detract from her achievement in my eyes. Nor was I surprised that she only has room in her life for immediate family and her business. As I consider whether and how much I want to grow my company, I look at her life and realize that I'm not as ambitious as she is. Yet I admire what she has done, and really admire her bravery as she bares herself in this revealing autobiography of her working years.Anyone who wants an honest inside look at what it takes in terms of commitment, hard work, and the ability to recover from mistakes and the inevitable setbacks along the way will enjoy reading Motherswork.

Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly ""It's not your fault"" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. I guess I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.<br /><br />Folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal.

But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They're easy to tell apart.

I ordered on March 11 thru some app. I know businesses don't like it due to high commissions but during the beginning of Covid uncertainty I wanted to be cashless. The prices were on high side and since this was a Mom and Pop run business I did not leave a tip for my takeout that I am picking up myself.  I usually do if it is a big operation with non family employees but I felt in this situation not necessary.  As a result they didn't treat me that great. 

I just flew in from California and I was starving. It was highly rated and not a huge detour that's why I chose them. I arrived after my pickup time and there are 2 tables of 2 people each dining inside. They tell me it will be a few minutes. It was like 12 additional minutes (now about 45 min total). They didn't even prepare it yet. 4 family members ""working"". Total inefficiency. I expected to be in and out. I didn't pay for meter and sprinted to avoid meter maid giving me a ticket on way out.  Just made it but he still made me put quarter in lol. 
 
The food was unremarkable and pricey for what it was. The momo (dumplings) were 2/5. Just didn't see the hype. I generally love dumplings, not these. The curry goat was 4/5 but smallish portion. Goat is cheap meat, lots of bones but tasty. Basically poor mans lamb.  Don't be stingy.  

Advice to owners. You obviously have pleased many of your customers. Work on efficiency. In today's Covid situation takeout will be your business model for years. Dining in is done for your operation, not that you have more than a few tables anyway. Have one of your young relatives design a website with a Shopify type option where you process pick up orders yourself.  No third party fees. It's so easy to build a basic and clean website now. No experience needed.  Link it to an instagram account too with photos of your food.

This is a comedy, though mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least, and it does not really have a goal.<br /><br />The movie starts on a friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes of several persons, some of them have nothing in common but they will come in contact with each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books nobody reads, a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men constantly in touch with the law, a man who works in a movie theater and two young women. Throughout the movie there walks a man who has something to do with wind. All characters have their troubles, with their family or friends or just with life itself.<br /><br />The movie is set in Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the port. The events of the day are not easily explained, I advise to simply watch the movie, there is simply too much to tell. But I can say this, Barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not really rock) to set a mood, especially the party is filled with excellent music.<br /><br />This movie is an experience on itself, it will not leave you any wiser about life, perhaps only that you have to live it and not waste it, or have any false moral truths.<br /><br />In short, see it, it is definitely worth it!",movie

1599,"In my humble opinion, Fundamental Neuroscience, edited by D.E. Haines, is an undiscovered gem! I am particularly impressed by the illustrations; this textbook combines actual photographs of brains, various types of brain scans, histological plates and color-coded schematic diagrams to give the best and most complete presentation of the nervous system that I have ever seen in my 30 years of university research and teaching. Whenever I have a question in mind concerning some basic aspect of the structure and function of the nervous system, I usually find myself leafing through this textbook to find the answer. Clearly, this book was written primarily for medical students; there are numerous excellent examples of clinical cases that can help cement the extensive information about the function and anatomy of the nervous system to the problems actually facing patients with neurological disorders. Some mention is also made of chemical and molecular mechanisms in neurotransmission, but in my opinion, this topic is not treated adequately. After all, most of the problems facing patients with neurological disorders are treated with drugs, so a thorough knowledge of the anatomical location and role of neuroreceptors is essential for medical students. Be that as it may, Fundamental Neuroscience spells out the circuitry of the nervous system more clearly than any other textbook that I know about, and this reason is enough for me to recommend it highly for those who need either to learn the topic from scratch or to have a comprehensive and well-written reference book on the shelf for consulting occasionally.",book
1600,"The story by Norman Maclean is a masterwork; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.",movie

1602,"Preston Waters is off to a bad summer. Besides his birthday coming up, nothing else looks promising.<br /><br />First he has to share his own room with his brothers who are going to run a business. They can't do it in their rooms because they don't have enough space. Off to a birthday party he only gets $6 tokens while others get $32, $35, and even $50. When one of his birthday cards comes early, he only gets a check made out for $11.<br /><br />Going to the bank he learns he needs $200 at least to start an account. Leaving the bank, a bully steals the check. Pursuing after the kid nearly gets him run over (definately his bike gets ruined) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley's just come from the bank too from giving the owner $1,000,000 to give to this guy tomorrow. Quigley starts to write a check for the damage, but only succeeds in writing his name before a police car circles the area. Afraid, he gives Preston the check, informs him to give it to his dad to finish out.<br /><br />That evening though, Preston tells his dad that he doesn't want a new bike, he wants his own room back, better yet his own house. His father confines him to his room for the rest of the evening. Moping in his room Preston figures things can't get any worse he realizes that he forgot about the check as it's still in his shirt pocket. It's blank.<br /><br />Using the computer and after careful consideration, he makes it out for $1,000,000. The next day, while trying to cash it at the bank he's taken to the owner who thinks he's the person he's supposed to give the $1,000,000 and does. He's not though as the real person named Juice comes in a moment later.<br /><br />Now the three have to track Preston down.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Preston has fun buying all sorts of stuff including his own house and even going on dates with a disguised bank lady who's really and FBI agent (who's trying to track the 3 bad guys down). He makes this person up named Mr. Macintosh who he works for and even plans a party for him on his birthday.<br /><br />But eventually things catch up (the money runs out, the bad guys get him).<br /><br />Overall, a pretty funny flick. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very good. If you enjoyed him in Another Stakeout, you'll love him here. He does all sorts of wicked crazy things.<br /><br />Rick Ducommun (the stressed out boss from Ghost in the Machine) plays a wonderful friendly chauffeur in this movie.",movie

1604,"It's a shame that an author as experienced and respected as Loren Coleman should feel the need to rush and criticise Mr Levy's book. It does smack a bit of professional jealousy. (And that's not mentioning his shameless plug for his own book!)I, for one, was very impressed by &quot;A Natural History of the Unnatural World.&quot; That he has been able to bring together such an extraordinary amount of material in such a lucid and accessible manner is no mean achievement. Levy obviously knows his subject, and I found the way he varies the writing style from entry to entry very effective. It's also very entertaining.A definite recommendation for both experts and non-experts alike. I thought I knew a great deal about the whole field of 'cryptozoology' (especially after reading Mr Coleman's book, amongst others), but this book certainly had enough science and factually based information to teach me much more.",book

Major story premises were removed, and new major story premises were added. <br /><br />What disappointed me most was how Nicolae was portrayed. He was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at this point in the books. Antichrist is not Satan, is not omniscient and not omnipotent. <br /><br />Faith and beliefs were portrayed in weird, surreal ways that seemed to make the movie just silly.<br /><br />Non-believers who watch this will have more ammunition to mock Christian beliefs.",movie

1607,"Loved the chicken we got here recently. It's perfectly spiced and has a savory flavor leaving you undecided whether the teriyaki or the original  is better. You really can't go wrong with either and price vis-a-vis portion seems fair. We also tried to ponko fries that have the perfect fried crispyness that makes it hard to stop eating. I'm sure they aren't very healthy but that's not why anyone would choose this option. Our family of three was able to split this comfortably.

The only thing that was less than stellar was the sticky rice, which was fine but nothing special. The cracked pepper and seasonings on the green beans are a bit spicy but nice and mix well with the fried onions. We liked the ponko pickles that come with the meals and the side salad is also good and it's worth mentioning that the dressing (sweet sesame) is made in house. 

Everything ordered came quick and this really was exactly the type of savory fusion flavors we we were looking for, highly recommend.",restaurant
1608,"First off, I agree with quite a bit that escapes Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His matter-of-fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus. He comes across likable, unassuming, pragmatic. He doesn't cater to the current political style (obnoxious bi-partisanship) and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right, chastising both, and for good reason.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film itself is a dud. In fact, I would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches. Watching ""Rebel Without a Pause"" is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no narrative.<br /><br />Technically speaking, the production is strictly amateurish. Audio is terrible and inconsistent; sometimes we cannot hear Noam speak, other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance. When Noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film and would say that you're probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or CD to listen to in the car.<br /><br />4 out of 10 stars...and I'm in a generous mood today.",movie

The story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) has crashed through the floor of a burning building, and only communicating with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) via the radio. The flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from being a recruit, seeing Kennedy as a father figure, to being a firehouse legend. Of course, in the present day, Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and it forwards to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known.

I'll just get the hard part out of the way... *sigh* the food I ate there last night made me very ill. I was in terrible pain from stomach cramps before the bill was even paid. The couple of hours that followed, I was in a lot of pain and discomfort that I wouldn't wish on anyone. My money is on the mole sauce, but who knows. I had the vegan plantain enmoladas which is a pretty simple dish of sweet plantains and beans wrapped in tortillas and covered in mole sauce. 

I sincerely hope this was a fluke and not indicative of regular mishandling of food and/or bad cleanliness habits because I reeeeeeaaally want to go back. My dinner was just ""fine"" and nothing to rave about, but they have a great menu, especially for vegans like ourselves. Mr. S ordered the jackfruit quesadillas and they were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I thought the restaurant had a great atmosphere with the covered patio looking across to the lake. The service was good and I definitely was feeling like this was a place we could come to more until I started to feel sick. Usually, I'd probably write them off for good after an experience like last night, but it's not easy to find an upscale casual place like this that is so vegan friendly.

This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust.<br /><br />A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) will only believe in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel.<br /><br />When he believes it, Fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly. It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris.<br /><br />Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's ""The Shop on Main Street"" directs this film as well. Kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces. She keeps calling for Ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion. For most of the film, she does not realize the Angel's appearance in her apartment.<br /><br />The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the Angel's girl friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment, is memorable but all too brief.<br /><br />We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he has died.<br /><br />Those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation.",movie

Went in on Canada day and the place was deserted. Two people in front of me were very upset( one had ordered and was waiting, other had received his order and was fuming) . 

One who had ordered was very upset that his order wasn't even being prepared yet as the girl took his order and went inside and didn't come back. He actually gave up and screams and left! 

The one who had already received his order was fuming coz he found a piece of plastic in his food which he should the sales girl and she threw it away. He wanted it back as evidence! The sales girls were clueless, panicking and even said ""I don't give a *uck about your piece of plastic"". 

Between all this I stood there waiting for my chance to order. I could have left like three people behind me did but my 5 year old was waiting for his muffin in the car. 

I placed an order and paid. The girl went inside and the drama around me escalated. I waited patiently for 12 mins(yup I timed) . And finally asked to be given my bagels and double double! She didn't care much and said oh we don't have the jalape√±o bagels! then why did you accept my order??!! She said ""we usually don't know when they finish""! What's this answer?

1636,"Wow, here is another great golf movie. That's at least three in the past few years that I've really enjoyed, that were well-done, beautifully-filmed and inspirational. The other two were ""Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"" and ""The Legend Of Bagger Vance.""<br /><br />This is a true underdog story, if there ever was one. To have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unheard-of feat. I believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished. How much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect, I don't know. I do know that I plan on reading the book, and I know that in real-life, Francis Ouimet had a three-stroke lead in playoff with just two holes to go, unlike what we saw in the film.<br /><br />Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is fact. It is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. It isn't something just for golf fans; this is a fun movie. Kudso to actor-turned-director Bill Paxton for an outstanding job.<br /><br />Yes, a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him. It's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. The movie also deals with Vardon's demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an elitist's sport, which it was at the time for both Europeans and Americans.<br /><br />Shia LaBeouf is winsome as Ouimet as is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day, maybe even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is pictured as a warm, nice guy; a genuine human being. the other major competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy. <br /><br />The fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-grade boy who winds up being Ouimet's caddie in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie.<br /><br />If all of this - a playoff with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole - were not true, you would think, ""Oh, man, this is so hokey. Who could believe this?"" That's what makes this true-life story fun to see finally captured on film. As with another sports film of 2005 - ""Cinderella Man"" - here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards. I guess nice films don't win awards.....just the hearts of their viewers.",movie

1639,"Ended up at Burgerim bc it was close to the English Pit.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  I realize that this is just a counter service restaurant, but the service I got here rivaled that of full service restaurants 2-3x the price.  

Covid protocols were strictly adhered to, and staff was wearing masks at all times.  Food was surprisingly good and better than I expect.  Sweet potato fries are usually amazing or meh...there isn't much middle ground for me with them.  I was happy that these were on the amazing end of the spectrum.  

Burgerim will likely be my regular go to spot after a range session.",restaurant

1641,"A cheesy ""B"" crime thriller of the early '50, the story is droll, the characters wooden, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only two sexpots that make it an eye-catcher, but one short shot, only a few frames long, shows an ""el"" train crossing the river on the State Street bridge, of the 6000 series Pullman-built cars painted in their original 1950 paint scheme, as they were delivered when new in 1950. For traction fans like me, that one short take makes the picture worthwhile. I think films like this one, Ulmer's DETOUR, D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien,THE FUGITIVE with Harrison Ford, and others of the film noir genre, (big city crime dramas) make it interesting if for nothing other than the fact that I know Chicago and San Francisco intimately and recognize most of the street locations.

1643,"In true ADD fashion, after being diagnosed I bought 3 books on ADD and checked out 4 more at the library. I loved this book through chapter 5. The section on the origins of ADD was presented as fact with lots of examples from the author's history. I haven't read this particular theory anywhere else, and I found it somewhat annoying. The theory is that ADD is caused by mothers who were depressed or anxious during pregnancy, or in infancy because (through postpartum depression or the mother's ADD) she couldn't properly bond with her child. As ""proof"" he cites the fact that adopted children have ADD in much higher numbers than the general population. What if adopted children have a higher likelihood of having ADD because their mothers have it? A woman with ADD might be more likely to give up their children due to feeling overwhelmed. The ""help"" section wasn't helpful. It basically recommended that you be understanding with your ADD children.

I especially liked that the character words were so well written and also that their thoughts were revealed to the reader to give us a complete picture of their motivation.I loved the two leading characters and thought they acted very maturely with the hardships they had endured in their lives before and during the time the story takes place.

It took a while to be seated which wasn't unexpected on a Saturday morning, but once we did make it to the table things too a turn. Our waiter seemed to question our choices as opposed to offering suggestions. When asked about vegan options he simply said nothing until the one item noted on the menu was ordered, our drinks took a while and then the food even longer, the waiter didn't stop by to check on coffee or too see if we were in need of anything. The restaurant offers a sample of their waffle upon seating  and though I could see this happening in other sections, we never received anything. We sat for about 30 minutes and a separate server brought our food. We requested the check and a box the check came but we sat and waited another ten minutes for the box that never came, much like the almond milk we had requested with out coffee",restaurant

1648,"Komodo vs. Cobra starts as 'One Planet' environmentalist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) & his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hire Captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Par√©) to take them to an island in the South Pacific, at first Stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes his mind when a load of cash is offered. Along with TV news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey) they set sail for the island & once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal DNA genetic experiments which have resulted in huge Komodo Dragon's & King Cobra's that have eaten almost every other living thing there & Stoddard & co are next on the menu...<br /><br />Co-written & directed by the ever awful Jim Wynorski under his Jay Andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful, this is just plain hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual rubbish 'Creature Features' the Sci-Fi Channel have the nerve to air if that's possible. The script is terrible, predictable & utterly boring, some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with DNA, a group of people are trapped with said monsters & have to try to escape being eaten. That's it, that's the whole plot of Komodo vs. Cobra, maybe this was trying to rip-off AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) with the title but all the 'vs.' bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second stand-off between the two titular beasts at the very end, boring as hell & surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash. The character's are poor, the dialogue is awful, the pace is slow, the story is predictable & clich√© ridden & the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both Komodo Dragon's & Cobra's are amphibious which they are not. Hell, Komodo vs. Cobra isn't even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since it's so dull & hardly anything ever happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the Cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />How does Wynorski keep getting directing jobs? He is probably consistently the worst director currently working, how can he keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts & still churn out such an awful film? I think this was cut to get a PG or for it's TV showing since every time someone swears it's masked by a Parrot squeak! There's zero gore or violence & the monster scenes are limp, people just sort of stand there, the monsters just sort of stands there too hissing or roaring & that's about it. The CGI computer effects are terrible, this is really poor stuff that just looks horrible.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $450,000 this looks as cheap as it was, the Hawaiian locations are nice to look at but that's about it. The acting is poor from an uninterested looking cast.<br /><br />Komodo vs. Cobra is an absolutely terrible Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' from Jim Wynorski, films don't get much worse than this.",movie
1649,"True stories make the best stories don't they? There's always something enjoyable about a story, be it novel or movie or whatever, simply by the fact that it's real makes the story all the more fascinating. This movie is based on a true story of two young American men, one a government employee and falcon enthusiast¬óChris Boyce (Timothy Hutton)¬óand the other¬óAndrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn)¬óis a drug dealer. These two begin selling government, mostly CIA, secrets in 1975 to the Soviet Union.<br /><br />The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially Penn's character with ever-worsening drug addictions), rather than glorifying their status as traitors to America, which would, no doubt, hurt the film's credibility in the US. Boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their dealings drag on and they dig ever deeper into treacherous territory. Daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened, and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he has no control over¬óon top of which, he already has problems with the law. The torment of Boyce and Daulton's families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against one's country, even if thought to be done justly, leads only to major problems and the ruination of lives¬óincluding the degradation of the friendship and trust between the two main characters.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />--Hutton and Penn each did extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel, so they're portrayed with extensive depth and realism.<br /><br />--The acting is excellent.<br /><br />--The atmosphere of paranoia builds quite well.<br /><br />--The story is fascinating, and of course, as one based on actual events, it has some added kick.<br /><br />--Nice sets.<br /><br />--The Soviets working with the Boyce and Daulton are portrayed very well, and not stereotyped or given evil consciences just for the sake of making them look bad.<br /><br />Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br /><br />--The music is alright, nothing perfect though.<br /><br />--Sound effects are occasionally a little iffy¬ósuch was the case with a lot of films from the seventies through the eighties.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />--Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman that we hardly know. Because of Boyce's trouble brewing with the US and Soviet Governments, her life can be put in jeopardy¬óbut this isn't as expanded upon as it feels it should've been. Minor problem, though.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />--The apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a little unnerving. Nothing like a constant state of unreadiness to keep the masses feeling as unsafe as possible.<br /><br />Memorable Scene:<br /><br />--Seeing the first CIA report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being, ""rough night.""<br /><br />This was another film that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story. Studios and producers didn't see how a movie about two American traitors could ever be accepted by American audiences. Luckily, it's filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality. Of course, it helps that the traitorous anti-heroes aren't portrayed heroically¬ómore like a couple young men who've made gross errors in judgment in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama, and one portrayed very well and very believably.<br /><br />Acting: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 8/10 (little quantity, high quality) Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 (one scene in a strip club) Violence/Gore: 7/10 (no gore, just some violence) Music: 7/10 Direction: 9/10<br /><br />Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10<br /><br />Overall: 8/10<br /><br />If you like films about espionage and spies, then you can't go wrong here.

1651,"What a dog of a movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is quite good, but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting, mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast. Many of the characters are woefully miscast, particularly the ever overrated Colin Friels.<br /><br />Very little works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the ""character development"" is done through a silly, angst-ridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters on-screen. In fact, it's hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen! How are we meant to know Colin Friels (Javo) is meant to be an erratic, violent and unreliable junkie? One of these silly voice overs tells us. For crying out loud, the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin' voice over! The real killer is the characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers. They are all absurdly well-spoken for ""junkies"". None seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them.<br /><br />Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than a weekday TV movie matin√©e. Crud like this, perfectly well shot and technically presented, but a clich√©-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere.

However they soon discover that the legend of the Fang Lady is far from the bedtime story many make out...<br /><br />Edited, executive produced, written & directed by Christopher Abram The Fanglys is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film. The script is very predictable, dull & doesn't deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever, in the right hands & with a decent budget The Fanglys could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isn't. It moves along at a fair pace but the on-screen 'action' is so poor that it doesn't matter, I don't quite know what else to say other than The Fanglys is a really bad film & I can't see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it. The dialogue is basic, the character's are clich√©d & lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time. There are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements & what was that retard keeping in that cage? I'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what happens to Jerry at the end then you'll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed, assuming you can actually make it that far of course (believe me it takes some doing).<br /><br />Director Abram doesn't do anything special. Abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish, I can tell him that it isn't when your film is supposed to be set in the woods. There's no atmosphere, scares, tension, excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good. Forget about decent gore, there's a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm & a pitchfork stuck through someones throat.<br /><br />Apparently The Fanglys had a filming budget of $2,837 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release, & to be brutally honest it shows. What about the retarded guy & his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous? The terrible special effects, the camcorder cinematography & the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through.<br /><br />The Fanglys is straight-to-video crap, it has no redeeming features whatsoever & it's low IMDb user rating score is fully justified, it's one of those films that within half an hour I was looking at the clock & wishing the thing would just finish.",movie

1656,"A star basketball player in high school, Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom comes to the realization that his life 8 years out of high school is a meaningless existence, even with a wife and son. His success on the court has not translated into success in life, perhaps making it harder to accept his current situation. Once adored as a top athlete and hero at his high school, Harry has evolved into a mediocre salesman living in a decrepit apartment with an apathetic wife. With this drab existence, Harry spurns his commitments (and responsibility to his family) and decides to run. Run where? Run for how long? These do not enter the bewildered mind of Harry Angstrom.John Updike delivers a masterful job of telling the story of this ex-jock and his current struggles with everyday life. He presents the raw emotion and feelings of a drifting young man. Harry is no hero. He is narcissistic, selfish, and immature, to say the least, yet Updike manages to elicit sympathy for Harry and his situation. Equally as intriguing as Harry Angstrom, is the character of Jack Eccles, a local Episcopal minister. Updike delves into the complexities of this man of God, as he struggles not only with ""reforming"" Harry, but also of his own doubts and inferiorities, as well as his embittered relationship with his agnostic wife.Religion and sex emerge as the dominant themes. Religion, neither lauded nor condemned, proves a pivotal role in shaping the lives of Updike's characters. The ideals of God's role and God's will perplex Harry and Jack. Even the existence or non-existence of God becomes a central role in the novel. Sex, undoubtedly, is the catalyst behind Harry's abandonment of his family. Updike does not describe sex as a sacred or meaningful, but instead describes it in rather graphic detail as a physical act without meaning or purpose. Indeed, for a book written in 1960, the sexual details are explicit, much more than the much-aligned ""Catcher in the Rye."", written a few years earlier. However, Updike's portrayal of sex lends more realism and more potency to his novel.It's easy to see why this is Updike's most successful novel. I will be reading ""Rabbit Redux"" soon.",book

1661,"to fully understand the relationship of art in the picture of dorian gray you must by this version.my review of this book is a little out of the ordinary becuase of the fac that it is an analytical essay for my 10th grade english class but after reading this it might give you a good perspective on reading this book.partically why i am posting it here is because iwant someone to read it because it was deemed ""not follwing the prompt"" by my teacher although i love her that was the worst mistake she ever made because i truly believe that this is a great essay:View from an Artists WorldOscar Wilde's way of writing is vivid, expressive and detailed. It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is ""The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim"". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he ""reveals"" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or ""conceals"" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his ""art"", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the ""artist"". Dorian's ""artist"" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to ""conceal the artist"" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul ""when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.""(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to ""conceal"" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's ""art"" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his ""painting"" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his ""soul"" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, ""No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style"" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:""You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do"" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his ""soul"" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their ""art"". And by saying "" I know the age better than you do "" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their ""art"". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; ""All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors"" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society ""I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil"" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's ""artist"" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading",book

1664,"There is a reason why the reviews of this place are so low. The food is definitely ""sub par"". I will also agree that you are better off going to get Mexican food elsewhere. The only good thing about this place are the wait staff. They are friendly and attentive. That is where it goes down hill from there. The fajita enchiladas were on flour tortillas. I can understand if you are trying to make a taco or something smothered. If you are going to make an enchilada, put it on corn. The tortillas were not even homemade. The fajita meat was very small. It has somewhat of a good favor. I had hoped to have bitter pieces of meat. I could not figure out what was going on with the queso. I had a strange ""aftertaste"" to it. The beans did not taste homemade. They tasted like they had come from a can. I did order a burger for my kid, which I figured they could not mess up.

Overall, this place is a little overpriced for a Mexican food restaurant. The food is mediocre at best. If you have low expectations, this place is for you. This was not the first time I had been to this place. I knew there was a reason why it had been years since the last time I was there. I know why now. I will agree with a previous reviewer that gas station Mexican food is way better than Esthers.",restaurant
1665,"If you want some down home southern food, Matthews is one of the places to go.  A friend that lives in Tucker recommended this place for an early dinner on a Thursday night.  I normally like to be the one in charge of picking places but I figured since he was a local, I would give him the reigns for the night.  Im sure glad I did because, as you can see, I give Matthews five stars!  I give it five stars for THIS TYPE of food/atmosphere.  It came through as a winner with me and Im a tough critic on this type of food. 

I got the fried chicken breast, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, turnip greens, and cornbread.  I have gotten these same items at several other restaurants and I can say for sure that the quality of Matthews ranks high, high enough that I may get this exact same order the next time Im there!  The iced tea was good too, something that, surprisingly, many restaurants mess up.  

The next time Im in Tucker, I will probably return to Matthews!",restaurant
1666,"Too often, 'The Cherry Orchard' moves dangerously close to that dread thing, the Shavian 'comedy' of ideas. full of facile symbolism, a schematic narrative arc and obvious allegorical characterisation, the play seems to groan under the weight of characters pontificating on grave matters such as social and historical change, the 'idea' of Russia and the rhetoric of freedom and progress.What saves 'Orchard' is the merciful fact that it was written by Chekhov and not Shaw. Whatever his overall conception of the play's weighty themes - the decline of the aristocracy; the new economic power of former serfs etc. - Chekhov is simply incapable of writing mere mouthpieces, and every character, no matter how monstrous, limited, avaricious, delusive or paralysed (in action or mind), is suffused with the kind of life (flawed, egocentric, perhaps, but human) for which he had a unique, sympathetic, though always honestly satirical eye. it is a tough task to make an audience empathise with a group of silly former slave-owners, but death, loss, change, poverty, personal failure and disappointment are things we have all felt, and we would probably be lying if we couldn't find something of ourselves in most of the characters (I, worryingly, found myself most drawn to the snobbish, immature, enndearingly gauche Gaev).There are too many emotionally loaded, privileged and enigmatic moments for characters to be simply straw targets, and the play is shot through with poignant autobiographical resonances (it was Chekhov's last, written when he was terminally ill). In fact, the one character I found thoroughly dislikable is the one who seems to make the most humanitarian sense, the revolutionary student Trophimof; but his tedious, inhuman sermons about work and the future sound too much like the Bolsheviks whose barbaric utopia would be established less than two decades later.Unlike Wilde, say, or Shakespeare, Chekhov rarely reads very well on the page. His deliberately plain speech can seem flat, and the importance of silence, waiting, time passing with an almost painful tangibility is impossible to convey, never mind the rhythms that become so evident in performance, or the use of sound effects and music (American translations seem to me the best, fluid and not fusty; I read Carol Rocamora's this time). This is why actors treasure him - his plays are almost like sketches, giving them unprecedented freedom to create characters from hints and ambiguities.Another difference between Shaw and Chekhov is that the former's plays are theses or theorems, designed to prove points the author is unswervingly convinced of before he's even written a word. Chekhov is rarely sure about anything, and his plays are liberatingly, if perilously, open-ended. Despite the rigid structures he fences them in, his characters always feel as if they have lived before the play and will continue to, no matter how badly, long after it.It should also be remembered that Chekhov called 'Orchard' a comedy: it is full of characters and scenes tottering from tragedy to farce. Charlotta, the tragicomic governess, full of amazing magic tricks and ventriloquism, yet fundamentally isolated and facing a desperately uncertain future, is perhaps emblematic.",book

1674,"Wuthering Heights is about the relationship between two people named Heathcliff and Catherine. Now, from everything I knew about this book before I read it, I thought the novel was going to be a great love story full of romance and hugging and declarations of devotion. Boy, was I wrong. At the heart of the book is a revenge drama carried out by a man so consumed by hatred that he makes Palpatine from the first Star Wars trilogy look like a nice guy.Heathcliff was raised from childhood with Catherine Earnshaw and her older brother Hindley, but Heathcliff was not related to them. Mr. Earnshaw brought Heathcliff home with him one day after finding him living the life of an orphan on the streets of London. I kinda suspect that maybe Heathcliff was a secret love child Earnshaw had with a mistress in the city. But that's just my take. Heathcliff rapidly becomes Earnshaw's favorite, even more so than Hindley, much to the son's disgust, which fuels an intense hatred and jealousy that only gets worse after the elder Earnshaw dies. Up to that point, Heathcliff had always been treated as a member of the family, but afterwards Hindley treats him as nothing more than a common servant to be abused and made to work his hands to the bone. And by abused, I do mean actual physical beatings. Catherine, the great love of Heathcliff's life, decides that he has nothing to offer her and instead marries Edgar Linton, the son of one of their neighbors. Hindley too, gets married. The only one left out of this whole lovefest is, you guessed it, Heathcliff, and he leaves the windswept moors only to return years later to exact his revenge on both families Monte Cristo style.I was really caught off guard by this book. Like I said, I was expecting a romance instead of a Shakespearean revenge tragedy. That's not to say there isn't a happy ending, but that it takes a long and convoluted path, wrought with broken lives and bittersweet death. What turns Heathcliff into such a monster is that both he and Catherine know that they were meant to be together but she makes the decision to reject him based solely on improving her social standing. And let's be frank, the supposed social mobility she craves doesn't amount to squat when you live out in the middle of nowhere in some backwater Gothic swamp. To me, I can almost see precursors to Faulkner's decaying nobility. Something else that really struck me about the novel was its haunting theme of sexual frustration. What Heathcliff and Catherine feel for each other is very sexual. There isn't any idealistic or poetic flowers growing out of each other's imagination. They see each other for what they are and love each other for what they are. Neither of them were cannibals but I almost felt like if they could find a way to eat each other, they would have.Bronte does a virtuoso job of moving between time periods and showing different generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons as the children of both have to deal with the legacy left them by the destructive failed love of Catherine and Heathcliff. The main narrators of the story are not the two main characters. Instead, the tale is told by Nelly, a maid just a little older than them who was a witness to everything that happened. She tells the story to a certain Mr. Lockwood, a man who is renting a house from Heathcliff many years after all this has gone down. Emily moves from present to past to future and back again during different chapters that really seems a more postmodern way of looking at things. This book was far ahead of its time in terms of novelistic technique.Bronte even takes up the issue of racism in Wuthering Heights, as part of the reason Hindley and the Lintons look down on Heathcliff is because of his ""dark gipsy skin"".I look at Catherine as a coward who recognized that Heathcliff was who she was meant to be with, but in her superficial thinking, she was more worried about marrying well (weren't all women of that time the same) than marrying for love. Marrying for love was for peasants. If you had money or land you had to marry an equal or someone higher than you. She chose wrongly and a lot of people had to suffer for it.",book
1675,"This piece is an excellent portrayal of life during the Italian Renaissance, but more importantly, the book is purely entertaining. Benvenuto Cellini tells the story of his life in a vivid tale of kings and prostitutes, artists and dukes, soldiers and necromancers, all the while proclaiming himself the absolute protagonist of his world. Cellini's autobiography is filled to capacity with egotism, but this only makes the story more interesting. In a good piece of literature of this type, a person wants to see a main character with absolute confidence in himself; a superhero if you will. Benvenuto may not be a superhero, but he tells his life story as if he was the greatest of all such legendary folk heroes. If children read this book or were read this book during their childhood, perhaps on the playground at recess, kindergartners would say: &quot;Hey let's play superheroes, I get to be Superman, I get to be Benvenuto Cellini.&quot; With the master goldsmith's stories about fending off six armed men with a single dagger, without a thought of fear in his mind, who wouldn't be solidly entertained?",book

1680,"Visited with my husband and friends on a Friday night. The place was surprisingly easy to find considering it's a speakeasy. Here are my thoughts:

Inside: Decor is very nice, amber lighting, leather seats, and great display of their liquor and cigars. 

Service: Excellent. We got seated immediately even without a reservation. Our server did an excellent job walking us through the menu and the RPB's process of ordering drinks based off flavors vs. spirits. 

Cocktails: This place is known for their handcrafted cocktails, one of which is the smokey old fashioned. Funny enough though, my husband and I are currently doing Dry January so we didn't get to try an actual cocktail but, they do serve hand crafted mocktails as well. We enjoyed a ginger drink (we mentioned our favorite flavor profile is ""spicy""), and our friends ordered the smokey old fashioned and a beautiful drink with a hibiscus on it. Our mocktails were delicious and presentation was beautiful, we certainly didn't feel left out. Our friends loved their drinks as well! 

Food: They have a pretty extensive Italian menu with appetizers like arancini and fried gnocchi; pasta like their lobster ravioli; but their shining star are the pizzas. We ordered the mushroom and truffle pizza along with one with BACON JAM. Both to die for! Order the crust ""carnival style"" for a ricotta-stuffed crust!

Vibe: So here's the only feedback that I'll give that wasn't stellar. RPB boasts being a classy establishment, from online rules on how to dress to rules in their menu on what they expect from their guests. Personally, I really enjoyed this about them because I'm a believer that rules lend to the exclusiveness of the place - basically, we're all adults here and let's behave as such. Unfortunately, there were several parties at RBP that were behaving so incredibly rowdy! Some girl was literally screaming, climbing all over her friends and even jumped behind the bar and started using a shaker. No one stopped her. Other guests were dressed in tattered clothing, which I normally wouldn't mind but there is a dress code to the RPB for a reason. Another party ordered a round of shots and screamed when they took them. 

Overall, great experience. If you're looking for low-key evening, this is your place. But fair warning that some parties may be there to have an especially exciting night.",restaurant
1681,"Yes, absolutely dreadful, And this coming from someone who loves bad movies - but there's a limit. I enjoy all sorts of horror/suspense films, and have seen some wonderful work from European film makers. Broceliande is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of film-making. The camera work is worse than amateurish. Not the fashionable, shaky MTV ""cameraman needs Ritalin"" type of camera work so many film-makers use to camouflage their lack of talent. This is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition. The acting is farcical when it is not entirely two-dimensional. The dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more so than your usual run-of-the-mill horror/suspense film delving into pseudo-mysticism. I think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. These were bad to the point of being ludicrous.

1686,"I think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated. When a person comes to watch a TV show, what does he look out for? It is to enjoy that he watches a show, unless he/she is a critic or a person who analyzes story. But most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office/school. It makes you laugh and it is not just humor.<br /><br />Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If any such family existed in real world, it would be a role model for us to follow. But this is a TV show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever be the comments later on.<br /><br />Another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it, but would take back a message however childish that message be. Those Jesse's talks with Michelle are extremely touching, if one doesn't think of it as childish.<br /><br />Overall I would say after watching every show of Full House, there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.",movie

There were times when the book dragged a bit and I wish it could have been written in more of a narrative style. However, I'm very glad I read it because Saratoga is a campaign that tends to be glossed over in classes while the focus is on the respective primary armies.

There are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks. For one, the score by a then unknown Christopher Young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly. The ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies. And last, but not least, the setting is what made the film for me. The makers of this film could have done a much better job ""dressing"" the set to make it more believable as a college dorm. However, if you can overlook this flaw, the setting is great.

(I still would have given the Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad I did check this movie out, because I enjoyed it immensely. I think the movie did preach a little, but not only did I not mind, I enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them.<br /><br />The acting was outstanding in this movie. I especially enjoyed Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (rightfully nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (wrongfully not nominated), George Coulouris and, oddly, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child. I really enjoyed his character: an odd-looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher. He just cracks me up. Even the characters name (Bodo) is funny. <br /><br />The ending, in which Lukas's character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons, worked for me as well. I agreed with why he felt he had to what he did, and I understood why he couldn't quite explain it.

This is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not. Mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead.Periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of S&M to the proceedings.

1700,"I have to admit that I'm a great fan of this show, so you must know how disappointed I got when I watched this movie. First of all, the plot was awful, I thought it was going to be something more interesting, like to see what happened to Arnold fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, between many other places, so many people tries to stop this.<br /><br />I must admit that the plot wasn't so bad after all, but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac, they become friends of a spy,; they drive a bus (based on a video game, for God sake), and to worse everything, they make super-moves on the bus, things that many persons had already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, 'cause they are experts on a video game.<br /><br />Honestly, my mom, my sister, even me got really disappointed after watching this movie, 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. I must admit that I used to enjoy ""Hey Arnold!"", it was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, but after this crap of movie, I'm not quite sure if I'm going to watch ""Hey Arnold!"" as I used to watch it on the past.<br /><br />Other thing Nickelodeon, with that enormous number of dynamite I can assure you that not a simple street would explode, I think that the whole city could explode with that, oh, and please, if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that, don't do more movies, you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good.<br /><br />Honestly, I think this was the worst way to end this show, a good show transformed into this crap of movie.",movie

1702,"Laughable would be a good term to describe this movie. But, since this movie deserves nothing good said of it, I'll use the term god-awful instead.<br /><br />Centering around the adventures of a bunch of eco-warriors investigating the nefarious doings of the military on a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget rapidly becomes apparent. Michael Pare (a real actor! But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy...) leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster chase-and-gobble-hapless-victim scenes. There is some vague attempt at pseudo-science to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer about as well as the acting does.<br /><br />As if this doesn't insult the viewer enough, the movie also features what I'll call ""Guns of never-ending ammunition"". I never saw Mickey Parrot or his female side-kick change clips once during the entire film, yet I can positively report they cap off at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon. Forty rounds may not seem like that many, but we are talking standard handguns here. I figure 15 round clip, tops. And remember, they never change clips, nor even appear to carry any extra ammo.<br /><br />It's dumb-assery like this which consigns movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell, and rightly so. The third-rate CGI does little to help matters and the acting is best laughed at, else you'll start crying. Why SciFi Channel repeatedly churns out this mush is anyone's guess.<br /><br />My advice....give this one a wide berth...a very wide berth!",movie

Of course it has some funny moments - the scene in the showers when Robbie Coltraine echoes Lon Chaney Jr's ghastly werewolf line ""I can't help myself"" is hilarious. But ultimately the plot, script and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 ""Hail Mary""s.

As an instructor of some of the local teachers, she decided to look into the literacy learning of these two communities. Trackton, an all black community, consists of people reading to learn. In Roadville, the all-white community is struggling with desegregation and parents wanting their children to learn the ""right"" things. The study of the Piedmont Carolinas--the area where the two communities are located--is important because it specifies that culture has everything to do with the way language and literacy is learned.

I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane? Although his career is laudable, an actor such as Lane would have cheapened the role. Cronyn was an excellent choice for the part. I will count this film as a true treasure to hold in memory.",movie
1710,"Following a roughly 7 year rocky road on NBC, it was decided to do just one last Super Installment. The Series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block-buster of a TV hour. It had always had a sizable, hard core of hard corps of followers. <br /><br />It was almost as if the series with the full title of ""HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET"" (1993-99) was a sort of ""Mr. In-Between"" of series. It was too big to just cancel, but too small to get a case of 'Rabid Ratings Ravings' over. <br /><br />During the precarious tenure on Friday evenings, they had presented some of the best and most daringly Artistic of Hourly Dramas. There, I've said it Artistic, Artistic!! But please, remember we mean Artistic, but not just Phony, Pretentious, Pedantic, Politically Correct preaching.<br /><br />When at last, it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for ""HOMICIDE""; this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for TV Movie. <br /><br />Looking at all the past seasons' happenings and parade of regular characters, the Production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off.<br /><br />OUR STORY¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö. As we join the story, we find that Baltimore Homicide Unit Commanding Officer, Lt. Al Giardello has ""pulled the pin"", Retired from the job, that is. But 'G' isn't ready to really retire-retire yet. So, instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod, we find that Al is running for Mayor of 'Charm City.'<br /><br />While out in the City, making some campaign stops and speeches, the former Detective Lieutenant takes an assassin's bullet. Alive, but in a comatose state, he is taken to the Hospital. <br /><br />News spreads quickly and as if officially summoned, we find all of the Detectives of the Baltimore Unit we've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance. There is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead.<br /><br />The Producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story. They managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones. The whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way. But at least for now, we'll leave that as ""classified"".<br /><br />In wrapping up everything into a neat, little package, this TV Movie surely gets our endorsement. As for grading ""THE HOMICIDE MOVIE"", we must give it an A or A+, even. But, no matter the Grade here, it didn't score as high as a typical weekly episode.",movie
1711,"Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) recounts the life of Korean painter Jang Seong-ub amidst the changing political landscape of late 19th century Korea.<br /><br />However, the themes of this film center around the process of artistic creation through the fire of desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of their audience and society.<br /><br />Jang seong-ub is played masterfully as a complex character who changes from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. This characterization mirrors the young eager artist that finds it more and more difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative fire out via drink, erections, and desire.<br /><br />Although this character development proceeds overall gradually through the film, the emotional complexity of Jang is still played in a constantly oscillating manner building to the films' finale. Interestingly, the montage of the film parallels this constantly changing and seemingly wild emotion or fire of the artist as scenes seamlessly transition from one time and location to another without any conventional 'cues' to the audience that such a scene change will occur. For example, many scenes would change seemingly in mid conversation picking up at another point and location.<br /><br />The visual scenery of the film is presented beautifully and also oscillates from stark (and perhaps bleak) black and white scenery to more colorful and alive environments that again parallel the paintings of Jang either in simple black ink on white paper or with color added. Rainbows of color enter the film at points as the artist observes nature and especially women that then become reflected in his paintings.<br /><br />The theme of an artist's individual desire to create versus the expectations and demands of society arises in the film through various points including class distinction, the domination of government over the artist, the accepted norms of the artistic elite, and the base desires of the common masses. Instead of creating his own completely original works, Jang finds himself mostly recreating masterpieces of other artists throughout East Asia. The question thus arises if recreation itself deserves artistic merit.<br /><br />I wish that I was more familiar with the political events of the period to firmly grasp how they tied into the story - but beyond any comparison to the current role of Korean government in artistic expression and/or censorship I cannot comment.<br /><br />Overall an extremely well acted film and the cinematography is often breathtaking. A great film to see and then ponder over.",movie

1713,"I had an older friend who admired Bertrand Russell and felt he was the bee's knees, and I've read he's the second most quoted author on college papers, after Noam Chomsky. Sadly, I'm no expert on Bertrand Russell. I've only read a few of his quotes and some information on Google, and this book Marriage and Morals. I like to think sometimes I can do a satisfactory review but this review will suffer, too, because it's been 20 years since reading it.Marriage and Morals is. . . an incredible display of ignorance. Monumentaly so. It might fly today, in, well, the ignorant times we live but I felt it was originally meant as satire, a work attempting to embarrass the very positions it was pretending to espouse. We're under the blinders. My honest opinion was that Bertrand Russell wasn't being serious, or honest.Let me say: I have absolutely no disagreement with Bertrand Russell's philosophy. My review of Marriage and Morals is not in any way an indictment or a criticism of Russell's lifelong career as a scholar. I should probably repeat that. When Russell wrote this book, however, he did so in the service of the very conservatives and theologians most folks would say were Russell's enemy. That was my honest opinion reading this work. Just one man's opinion. I may well be wrong I felt it was better to give my one opinion rather than remain silent. Russell was banned from some speaking engagements and from some jobs because of this work, by the very folks who put him up to it, and rightfully so. If you'd like to read an objective and unbiased account of this, worthy of enlightenment, Google the episode.I would compare this work to The Satanic Bible, a work where the author took what he knew of christian philosophy, and simply reversed it. There are around 500 mostly positive Amazon reviews of that book. One reviewer wrote, ""I'm sure if the 100s of millions of non-practising Satanists around the world were informed that their lifestyles were 'Satanic' by definition, most would be surprised, if not amused. But so long as they're living for themselves just trying to enjoy their lives, regardless of religious dogma, seldom or never have spiritual thoughts, think that if someone harms them they have a right to avenge themselves, only spend time with people who are good for their own personal growth, and feel no guilt when indulging in any of their passions, then they fit perfectly into the Satanic lifestyle"". To add some more superfluous commentary, the Bible often concedes the Earth as Satan's domicile.My review of Marriage and Morals is definitely in the minority. Only about 1 out of 10 agree with me. . . The New York Times doesn't. It gave this work a glowing review. The New York Post wrote ""sufficient dynamite to blow a carload of ordinary sex populizers off the face of the planet"". Another reviewer wrote, ""Wow, Bertrand Russel is a riot! This has a wonderful satirical bite, and works as an open inquiry. . . But really a little sad but impressive how much of his comments have either come to pass. Or we are still awaiting them to do so"".Later in life Russell was in an open marriage, practicing what he preached. When his wife was pregnant with another man's child, it was too much even for Russell. The champion of free love petitioned for (what I assume was a very public) divorce.There's a long history of this. Camile Paglia claims the 'the divine' Marque de Sade was actually a satirist also. Or an alarmist of some kind. Providing a 'warning', a roadmark to where society was heading. The conspicuously named 'libertines' in his stories engaging in more and more sadistic behavior, until in the end he just lists the atrocities committed each day as a list and nothing more. He's not too far from a 'truth' anti-cigarette campaign. On his death bed de Sade wanted people to know he truly was a pervert. Perhaps it constitutes a syndrome. Mentally ill folks who blame, not the conservatives and the moralizers, but the very people who champion them and want to celebrate their 'perversion'.I remember as a kid, during economic tough times, reading about Jimmy Carter's 'malaise' speech. I took it seriously. I had no idea Jimmy Carter was attempting to make fun of himself. Was watching an excerpt of the speech on TV recently and it certainly appeared that was what Carter was actually doing. For all of Our lives I think it's worked the opposite way. At least I think most of those on the extreme far right that you can find on Google are actually in play for team diversity.For a view from the right, there is George Gilder's 'Men and Marriage'. It's an interesting topic. It's an important topic though I don't think George Gilder on the right has all the answers either. I just felt this book, while very informative, often drew the wrong conclusions and so was self defeating, and was intended to be.",book

I presume because most of us mortals are only blessed with a certain dose of brilliance and once that's used, tough luck. One theory--the author wrote ''Ashes'' long ago, or at least kept a journal so his remembrances were fresh. When the first book took off, he was forced to write the next installment and he was working from faded memory and writing through too many years' worth of cynicism. The lack of humor in the sequel was glaring, and that was the biggest letdown to me. ''Ashes'' was a revelation and ''Tis'' was a slap in the face. Sorry to be so hard on the author, but my expectations were dashed.",book

Then things get strange.<br /><br />A big X-rated art house hit in the US in 1983. Why was it X rated? Let's see...there's strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! Paul Verhoeven made this after ""Spetters"". ""Spetters"" was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. So, Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still, it's a great film. <br /><br />It's beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious ""hidden"" layers in the dialogue that you're never bored. All the acting is great--Krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with Krabbe in the crypt.<br /><br />This is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you!

The chips were awesome! Super crispy. The queso was good as well. I thought the guac had good texture but not enough flavor - could have used a bit more lime, salt and spice. I do tend to prefer things to have more flavor than others so that might just be a matter of preference, though. Their tacos were really good and HUGE. Alongside the chips and dip, I think I could have survived with just one taco honestly. I got the veggie and the pork and enjoyed both of them.

1723,"This is one of those topics I can relate to a little more than most people as I hate noise & have no idea how those in big cities, New York especially how people get any sleep at all! It astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days. The basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic. It's too bad that's about it. Tim Robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel looking Margarita Leiveva) he didn't seem to really be altogether there. My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning & talented actress to boot, Margarita Levieva. She doesn't have a lot to do, but she is supermodel beautiful. Even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door. It makes me sad that there can be people such as Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world w/no redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I didn't care for much of this film because the script isn't very good, but am glad I got to see some new talent. I hope that producers & directors think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film. If they can make Megan Fox a star (c'mon she isn't that hot, & her acting ""talent"" is worse than made-for Disney channel TV shows) from 1 film, it should happen easily for her, as she is gorgeous & has talent!

1726,"Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. The script for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction.<br /><br />On this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). That's not how life works, that's not how people are. This show doesn't take place in this reality.<br /><br />The plot lines are about as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the ""bad guys"", act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. The lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. It's as if the scriptwriter for the part of Wesley Crusher (for the ""serious"" parts) and the scriptwriter for Bob Saget's funniest home videos (for the ""humor"" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.<br /><br />This show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. It's for the elderly. It's for wishful thinkers. It's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. It's for people who want to drift away into oblivion. It's for people whose drug of choice is their television.<br /><br />I cringe every time I see even a commercial for this show.

1728,"If I had never seen the first Road House, then I guess this movie might get one more star, but even then that makes it a 3 star movie. For that matter I was really surprised as to the relatively high rating it currently has.<br /><br />In reality, I was not able to finish this movie, as it was painful. Where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) is that it pretty much parallels the original exactly even though the original plot is still referenced. This doesn't really make sense and doesn't work. Also, the acting is weak...I never felt like I was into the movie yet I felt like I was watching people act. Even good actors like Busey don't work out, probably due to the screenplay or maybe the awkward editing. The strangest thing is that the movie feels like a mid 90's B movie, yet is made in 06. I am not sure as to why, but then again, this often seems to happen with sequels for some reason. The music, the look, and the whole overall feel reminds me of movies you saw 10 years ago on Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing of all is that I am also expecting Ja Rule to come in at some point...often it reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors.<br /><br />The most irritating thing is love interest girl who's character seems like a total rip off of the Lois Lane character on Smallville which is also quite annoying. And lets not forget the fakest sounding ""southern accents"" I have heard since Walk the Line. I realize this is common place in movies, but no accent at all would work better than attempting to sound like you are from that universal hick place on TV where anyone from any southern state (or KY and WV) sound exactly the same. Sure, people in desert towns in AZ sound just like people in Southeastern states 2000+ miles away. That was wearing thin 10 years ago in the B movies where technique came from. Why do writers / directors make such decisions? <br /><br />Bottom line: I would truly not recommend this if you are a fan of Road House or if you like good movies. Also, if you have not seen it yet, don't spoil it by seeing this version first. The original Road House was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch over and over. It was an unexpected success like American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and more recently Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first one!), and Napolean Dynamite. Why did they spoil it!!!???<br /><br />They should have never made a sequel to Road House other than a high budget version with the right actors / director. Sure, you can never top the original (ex: Bad News Bears, The Longest Yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it right it will be presentable as is the case with the examples I mentioned. But to make a low budget, off-network, self production of Road House is criminal.",movie
1729,"I thoroughly concur with the other reviewers that said this should be your second or third Bible version, not your first one. I use the New King James as my primary Bible version and NIV when I want a freer translation. The Amplified Bible fills in all the gaps. Anybody who is at all familiar with the process of translation knows that often it's very difficult to express a concept wrapped up in one word of one language into one word of another language. To fully express many single words from Greek, for example, can require 3, 4, 5 English words since there are nuances of meaning (and in some cases we are not 100% sure which one is applicable). (I don't mean to imply that any doctrines of Christianity are in doubt - they're not. The nuances are not that important. But they do give you a different flavor of some parts of the text.)The reason most translators don't take those 3-5 words is that the resulting translation is almost unreadable. You need to read it very slowly, one phrase at a time. Most translations don't do this because they are aiming at both accuracy and readability. (I'm speaking of reliable translations here, not biased ones like &quot;inclusive&quot; versions or the &quot;New World Translation&quot; of the Jehovah's Witnesses.)The Amplified Bible takes the other approach: fully list all possible nuances, and let the reader sort it out. As a result, the Amplified Bible is virtually impossible to read the way you would read a novel. But if you want to explore the nuances of one verse at a time, it's probably the next best thing to knowing the original languages.The reviewer who said that we have too many Bible translations clearly has a King James only point of view.

While they had sanitizers, the staff were not wearing masks. I am hearing that most other quality restaurants are having their staff wear masks, for very good reason. We were two at a table for four, but our server did not serve food to the empty side of the table, or take our orders from the empty side. Even the staff at the little sushi restaurant in our local mall know enough to do that. Finally, our server hovered very close to us, at times OVER our food, and I had to ask the server to step away at one point. This place has nice pizza, but they are telling me by their actions (or inaction) that they can't be bothered to take well-known and obvious steps to try to protect my health. I therefore don't plan to eat there again.",restaurant

Do yourselves a favor and hit a different chicken joint if feeling like lightly breaded chicken fingers cause you won't get that here.",restaurant
1735,"This is the third Wolfe novel I've read (after The Father Hunt and Champagne for One) and while I obviously can't compare it to the rest of the series as a whole, it is certainly my favorite so far. In fact, it suprises me that many reviewers didn't care for it, because I find that it's an excellent blend between the British cozy mysteries by Agatha Christie and the American hard-boiled mysteries by Raymond Chandler.In this one, Wolfe must solve the murder of an affluent industrialist which occurs before the book begins. There are, admittedly, a slew of characters here (about ten suspects in all), my of whom are difficult to keep track of, and about half probably have less than 15 lines in the entire story, but characterization of minor characters is sacrificed here for plotting. Less than halfway through the story, a second victim is murdered literally on Wolfe's stoop, and in perhaps the best moment of the story the police advance upon the brownstone for an all-night interrogation session with the suspects and some interesting clues are discovered involving one suspect's scarf and another's overcoat.Part of the fun is the search for a dictaphone cylinder which the victim used to narrate a memo to his secretary on the very afternoon of his murder. It becomes clear that once the police find this cylinder, they will find their murderer. Of course, Wolfe beats them to it in the end, and when he reveals his methods in doing so I had one of those head-slapping ""why didn't I think of that?"" moments.If you're looking for a surprise twist at the end where the killer is revealed as the one person you'd never expect, you may be disappointed here. The killer is one of the ten suspects, and although the solution is amply explained, his/her identity didn't throw back the curtain on any surprises. Like I stated earlier, however, the characterization of the secondary characters is taken away to give us some rich moments between Wolfe and Archie.Fans of the series may enjoy such unique moments as Inspector Cramer being fired from the police force, Wolfe slapping a police detective across the face, Wolfe making an appearance on the brownstone's first floor in his pajamas, the discovery of a dead body almost literally at the front door (it's not so much the body per se, but the identity of the victim and the way it's discovered that are a treat), and Wolfe retreating to his bedroom for almost a week feigning insanity to avoid an arrest warrant.Good, solid stuff. I would recommend it to new fans as well as those who are already fans.",book

1741,"Of Mice and Men opens with a perfectly 19th-century-like description of a creek. We almost expect a respectable bourgeois couple to emerge from the trees discussing a ball or an engagement. Instead we get Lennie and George:""So you forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you again, do I? Jesus Christ, you're a crazy bastard!""""I forgot,"" Lennie said softly. ""I tried not to forget. Honest to God I did, George.""""O.K. - O.K. I'll tell ya again. I ain't got nothing to do. Might jus' as well spen' all my time tellin' you things and then you forget 'em, and I tell you again.""""Tried and tried,"" said Lennie, ""but it didn't do no good. I remember about the rabbits, George.""It's hard to appreciate, I think, just how steeped we are in these archetypes now. They are instantly recognizable to the contemporary reader. George and Lennie are popular culture.Of Mice and Men is a long way from Dickens' fixation with the workaday dilemmas of the faintly well-to-do, which is in itself a far cry from the country gentry of Austen and Bronte. Some of Hardy's better novels dwell on the workers, but never quite believably. Though his father was a stonemason, his fingers aren't dirty enough. And it has always seemed to me that Faulkner's portraits of working folk bear the imprint of a soft-handed gentleman, the brilliant observer with fingernails stained by ink, not dirt. Doubtless I am missing others.So along rolls the Great Depression. Steinbeck is right there to chronicle it. (Avoid the dreary In Dubious Battle, which reads like a museum-piece.) Steinbeck's fingers might not have been callused - evidently he, too, was more observer than doer - but he wrote as if they were. Lennie and George have come to stand in for a whole generation, while the depiction of the black stable buck Crooks is especially poignant today, mere hours after America's first black president has delivered his first State of the Union address.Steinbeck is no master stylist. He uses too many apostrophes in the hunt for accuracy of dialect and his descriptions are sometimes flat and leaden. But if you read with your spine as Nabokov suggested, Of Mice and Men is an unbridled pleasure. It recalls the joys of childhood reading, the kind that highfalutin literature and pedantic high school English teachers often kill. Of Mice and Men is finely-rendered tragedy coated in a working man's dust and sweat.George said, ""Guys like us got no fambly. They make a little stake an' then they blow it in. They ain't got nobody in the worl' that gives a hoot in hell about 'em - """"But not us,"" Lennie cried happily. ""Tell about us now.""George was quiet for a moment. ""But not us,"" he said.""Because - """"Because I got you an'--""""An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in hell about us."" Lennie cried in triumph.",book
1742,"I don't ask much from the books I read. Give me a couple characters I like, make some things happen that interest me, throw in a little suspense or tension, and I will probably like it. This book has all of these, plus a very interesting idea. I don't read books to analyze the prose, I read to be told a good story. As long as the author's writing doesn't get in the way of the narrative, I don't care how he writes, nor do I care how literarily acceptable his writing is. As for this book, I can't tell you how good the writing was or was not, as I didn't pay attention because I don't care. All I can say is that it didn't bother me, or in other words, it didn't get in the way of the story.However, if you are a liberal or perhaps even just a moderate democrat, you probably won't like the protagonists, hence you probably won't like the book. If you are more conservative, and you like the military genre, and you are more interested in hearing a good story rather than reading perfect prose, then you probably will like this book, and I highly recommend it. I, at least, thought it was a pretty fun read.",book

1744,"New York police detective Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life. The strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals, leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law. He has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used. Dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals. He is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence.<br /><br />When a rich Texan is murdered following an evening's gambling run by gangster Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill), Dixon is assigned to the case. Scalise tells Dixon's superior officer Detective Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden) that the victim had been accompanied by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his wife Morgan (Gene Tierney) and that Paine had committed the murder. Dixon goes to Paine's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when Paine punches him, Dixon retaliates and Paine collapses and dies. Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river. Paine's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at Scalise's place, adds that her father had gone to Paine's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she'd returned home with facial bruising. Paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), had threatened that if it happened again he would beat Paine up. This information leads to Taylor being arrested and charged with murder. Nobody accepts Dixon's explanation that Scalise had killed the Texan and then had Paine killed to eliminate him as a witness.<br /><br />Dixon continues to make various attempts to get Scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in Paine's death and the cover up. He does this and also records that he is going alone to confront Scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for Dixon's murder. The confrontation with Scalise and the eventual means by which Dixon achieves his own redemption, provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller.<br /><br />Dana Andrews' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow Paine's accidental death. Dixon, however, isn't the only one to experience misfortune as Morgan, a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her. Her father, who'd some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police, unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit. Ken Paine who'd been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and Scalise who'd been set up in business by Dixon's father also suffers his own misfortunes.<br /><br />""Where The Sidewalk Ends"" is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity.",movie

1751,"""Kaabee"" depicts the hardship of a woman in pre and during WWII, raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for ""thought crime"". This movie was directed by Yamada Youji, and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful. Although the historical correctness of some scenes, most notably the beach scene, is a suspect.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. I am baffled at how they managed to gather this all-star cast for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, possibly the most decorated still-active actress in Japan, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well. It was Asano Tadanobu though, who delivered the most impressive performance, perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was in.<br /><br />Films with pre-war setting is not my thing, but thanks to wonderful directing and acting, I was totally absorbed by the story. Also, it wasn't a far-left nonsense like ""Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni"", and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan.

I have played hockey all my life and have watched even more, and this my friends is sheer lunacy. The scenes on the ice were stupefyingly bizzare... the particular instance to which I am referring is the ""sword fight"", er I mean the ""stick fight"" at the end of the film... during which everyone is just standing around and watching, not with fascination that this is actually happening, but in wonder as to who will win the duel between Youngblood and his nemesis Rakkie.

1754,"Incarcerated train robber near Yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style violence and brutality isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. It is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters merely around as punching-bags and possible rape victims. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses).

1756,"Kushiel's Dart began with difficult imagery, but after the second chapter it became a real page turner. I find myself agreeing with some of the other reviewers about its flaws, but if one isn't particularly judgemental about the character's sexual preferences the story stands well on its own.It is true that the story is told from Phedre's point of view in such a manner that one can only discover the plot in written word, regardless of how obvious events may be, when the main character herself finds them. Sadly, it's my opinion that this is a limitation of the first-person point of view, not the author's plot design. Generally the story was creative enough that I did not correctly second-guess every turn of event, and I doubt most people would either.This book, however, was written for a certain type of person. It relies heavily on the worship of forms (Socrates and his belief in a universal beautiful, etc), the idea that the reader hungers to read of a people who are ""perfect"". In this manner, I found the book to be more high fantasy than most of the reading I've gotten my hands on in the past five years or so. Though this appreciation extends to S&M;, which I'm sure causes a great deal of the core revulsion in several readers who cannot fit such things into their value systems as ""beautiful"", it isn't particularly offensive to the person without prejudice to those types of sexuality. Kushiel's Dart smoothes over literal events in the bedroom and betrays less than 99% of the romance novels I've read.There are always people who walk into reading a book of this nature with previous feeling that the values presented are fundamentally wrong. For this reason, though the book rates high for an overall read, I would caution anyone who actively disapproves of or dislikes S&M;.",book

Hans Zimmer's score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated, untalented composer.<br /><br />But if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story, a sort of European version of Edna Ferber's family epos Giant. While at first you wonder why Clara married this idiotic man, even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by. Clara delivers the movie's spiritual lesson, a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country. Her daughter, whose lover is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it. The way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great. The actors all do a great job, too.

So what explains their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success?<br /><br />Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to North America by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus *without a single casualty* in either case, then I think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we were going to succeed.<br /><br />He says Malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing further North, killing ""thousands"" of Europeans while not affecting Africans.

Did Malaria help the Africans by halting Eurpeans or hurt them? And how come Europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history? <br /><br />He also seems far too eager to say that the reasons Europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck. At times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he's reluctant to admit that maybe Europeans were successful because they worked for it.

1771,"I wonder how much trial and effort is behind this book? From what I read in this well-illustrated, plainly-written guide I think this is not a bodily-improvement manual for the average woman and is more suited to someone who is already a fitness and health fanatic. I'm trying to incorporate a few exercises here into my morning yoga but I don't think I'd embrace the entire program. That's just me, though. I don't think anything presented here will harm anyone but it's also not going to be easy enough that anyone can pick up this book, read a few chapters and get going to where she'd see immediate benefit. I guess what I'm saying is the jury is still out on this since I've only had it six days and it's too severe and intimidating for just anyone to get major use from it. But, again, that's just my opinion and the important thing about any exercise or body enhancement project is to simply GET MOVING. If this helps with that then it's done what it's supposed to do.

The staff were lovely and the food was amazing; I especially loved the battered fish and the sausage from the grill. And the fresh blueberries at the salad bar were the nicest and largest I had ever seen. In January, no less! It was helpful (and great value) for them to allow me to order by the pound; my huge plate of food came to a little over $13, while my husband opted for the AYCE and had 3 platefuls before he was done. We both got exactly what we wanted. I ate every bit of mine and couldn't hold more...until our server surprised us at our table with a huge slice of chocolate/strawberry cake (and extra plate for sharing) with a lit candle in it to celebrate my husband's birthday. The cake was on the house - no charge. It was a lovely thing for them to do. This is a place I want to come back to!",restaurant

You create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team(you can pick a team to be on) and you then start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II(not part of story mode though) from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons, and another skater. You can create your own goals like SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap, and much more. You can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak. If you get bored of doing that, you can do the premade goals in premade parks.

1775,"For three quarters of an hour, the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort. Although it is overburdened with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot, there is something happening. It is not much and it certainly is not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and story-driving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters. In fact, they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all. Everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own clich√© and role - the cute, kinda headstrong girl; the fighting √ºberwoman, the snobby aristocrat. The male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all, he is a shallow presence, which, actually, doesn't even matter as he is only there because the storyboard required him to - it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up. When the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening, the movie first snaps completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous. It solves - or better, dissolves - itself with a by-the-book Deus Ex Machina, more clich√©s and some of the most crude plot devices and choices I have ever seen. It's history, alright. First the movie's a drama though it's supposed to be comedic, and then it turns into a farce. The protagonists do what they are expected to do, and there are no surprises. The first set of somewhat serious antagonists however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored. Maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audience.<br /><br />This movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning (since there is none) nor for its technical realization. The animation and editing is fair and so's the sound mixing; but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average Japanese productions of the late 1980's. In fact, the visual treats seem static, un-inspired and un-original.<br /><br />Worst of all - it totally fails to entertain, even if you don't bother with characters and all that stuff. There's too little going on here, and the rest is corny at best. Get a real Ghibli instead, have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one.",movie

From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man.

He's bullied by neighborhood kids, which i don't blame them because he's a little douche bag.<br /><br />The story is just plain stupid and extremely clich√©.

We stood in line for about ten minutes before seeing a menu. Once we made it to display case a gentleman offered his menu to us and we could for the first time see what this place had to offer. About 5 minutes after looking over the menu an employee came over and asked us if we were ordering to-go or eating in. We told him we were eating in and he said it would be about a 20 minute wait. He took my name and phone number and said he would text us when table was ready and then we could order. We then had to get out of line and wait for a text. 20 minutes later we get a text and are told our table is ready and to get back in line to order. Now the line is longer than when we first arrived so we get back in line and wait another 15 minutes before we get to order. My wife orders the tiramisu and ... they are out. Ha! You'd think on those two digital displays that maybe they could have a message alerting customers what is sold out? I order the chocolate salted caramel petite cake and ... they're out of that too! We left and we will absolutely never be back.

Scholars will find new insights into the songs, and a lengthy bibliography. One of Lynch's principal points is that &quot;unlike their husbands, brothers, and fathers, women lyricists drew an overt connection between the deprivation they saw their families experiencing and the fight for higher wages, improved working conditions, and collective bargaining rights.&quot; Lynch's prose sparkles, and this sets his book apart from so many others published by academic presses.",book
1786,"Lucid, well-written, ably-argued, and vehemently anti-racist.This book sets out to answer the question of why different societies progressed at different rates and why some societies were able to dominate others so well. Diamond presents his theory that environmental factors are at the core of the answer.Starting with the development of agriculture and animal domestication, history is traced through the spread of the original crops of the Fertile Crescent. Societies that were early in developing agriculture were able to settle into sedentary societies which allowed for increased population capacities and in turn the development of technology.The title of the book refers to the ways in which advanced cultures were able to overrun less-advanced cultures. The scenario repeats itself throughout history, from the first push of Homo Sapien Sapien into the European territory of the Neandertals, to the decimation of the American Indian at the hands (and germs) of European colonists in the Americas. Diamond points out the difference in technology and disease immunity and traces backwards through history to find the causes of these differences.He is able to make the arguments of cultural superiority without resorting to arguments of racial intellectual superiority. Through his clear exposition, the reader is able to follow how some societies were able to succeed and some to fail as dictated by the environment in which they lived. The reader takes away from all this that racial advantages were due to chance rather than bigger brains or higher natural intelligence.Diamond added a chapter about the Japanese in this latest version. However, it does not seem to fit in well anywhere. The rest of the book is about the societal adaptations to the environment, but the Japanese chapter is about the genetic and cultural evolution of the Japanese people. It's interesting, but out of place.In all, this is a magnificent book. It lays a foundation for the understanding of all further history, and stands up well to competing theories of human societal evolution. 5 enthusiastic stars for this book.",book

However, I don't know if I'll ever watch this movie again...and I bought it. Now, after saying that, I bet the commentary tracks and special features will be worth watching! This movie just has far too many holes for me to actually enjoy, even as a cheapo movie. First off, Ted Raimi was annoying, just flat out annoying. There was nothing to his badly acted / written character that hasn't been done better a thousand times before. The directing sadly was sub par and the choice of some shots...yikes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell did not deliver.<br /><br />I did not purchase this thinking it was going to be an Oscar movie like 'Annie Hall', but still I'm disappointed. I would have been happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I got much less. By the end of the movie there were no scenes that popped out to me, no dialogue that resonated within me.

1794,"After too many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons' noted 1979 book ""The House Next Door"" has finally been filmed. The result veers a bit from the novel which, especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a TV film, the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good, just not as great as the book, one of Stephen King's favorites and one of mine as well.<br /><br />With more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release, all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured, especially the climactic revelation near the very end.<br /><br />Still, the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence. There are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed. Actually, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next-door amateur-artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas.<br /><br />Be sure to read the great novel.",movie

1797,"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: ""I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world."" ""Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.""I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces.",book

Note: My uncle is partially blind.  I think you can easily tell..  If you can't tell, you would think he was unable to read.
he had a $5 bill and $100 bill on him.  He asked if there was a roast beef on the menu for $5 and the guy snapped at him saying ""no"" and rudely pointed to the menu.  If there was a $5 roast beef, he was simply going to order a roast beef. Since he was told no, he ordered a roast beef, fry and drink. Paid with $100, asked for a receipt and left. When he got in the car he asked me how much the sandwich was and I told him $5.50. Why could the guy simply not tell him that?  Why so rude?  If he had known, he would've ordered a roast beef handed him the five dollars and reached into his pocket for his change. What if he only had $5?  Most decent human beings wouLd have stated the price of a roast beef along with 1 or 2 other items fOr $5 or under.....just in case money was the issue.

I was completely taken aback by the subject matter and how profoundly it has affected me. The reason why I will not give away any description about the subject matter is because not only is it readily available but also because I think everyone should purchase this book and discover for themselves why her books are still in print. Rand's books should be read often and more than once. Universities should have all her books as required reading for freshmen; better yet they should have a specific Ayn Rand course where her books would be read and discussed for their meanings.

1802,"I love this book.I was walking through a bookstore years ago, just browsing for an author or series I'd never read about before; I was searching for something new. The title &quot;The Magic Engineer&quot; caught my eye, since I'm an engineer, and I picked it up. Of course, it was part three in a series, so I grabbed the first book, The Magic of Recluce, and headed home.That was the start of my love affair with this series and Mr. Modesitt's writing in general. You, the reader, can tell from the other reviews here that Mr. Modesitt's writing tends to polarize reviewers into loveit-hateit camps, and it largely depends on where your focus is in reading. If you're looking for page after page of fighting and 'tension', move on to the Shannara series. If you look for depth and development, read on!This book is not the best of the series, and several items he introduces in this book he 'backtracks' on in later books as the magic system develops and becomes more realistic. For example, in this book the great White mage performs magic on an old ewe, and &quot;The two trays weere heaped with succulent sliced and and steaming mutton, with joints at the edges, and with sweetbreads piled at each end. A sheepskin rug lay on the floor beside Antonin...&quot; In later books, we become aware that White magic can only destroy, and largely manifests itself as fireballs. A fireball that would burn the ewe to a crisp, but would not slice it, season it, and prepare bread too! This is the most extreme example of what is started in the first book and later modified.The writing is a bit 'thick' as you try to absorb all there is to know, but the payoffs are a world, magic system, ethical systems, nations,politics, and individual personalities that are *rich* and believable.Mr. Modesitt's strength lies in bringing the reader to understand that in his world, the great and the powerful are just ordinary people like you and me who have been faces with extraordinary challenges due to their birth in history, most times facing circumstances well beyond their control. The characters, largely speaking, just want to be left alone to lead their lives and help others, and they continually get put in circumstances where they *must* deal with strength.Yet, Mr. Modesitt does not spend a lot of time with battles. His books grow the characters, their circumstances, and the people the know and love. Most fights are something to be finished as quickly as possible so that the characters can get back to their lives, and this is how they are written.This is an exceptional review from one of my absolute favorite authors, and highly recommended to anyone looking for Fresh SciFi.

On the way of the meeting, he confesses that they had traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the wish of the reckless Kyle, who is his best friend since their childhood, of eating a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext to Kyle's father Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith).

Meanwhile, Kyle's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and has a non- corresponded crush on Mitch that sees her as a sister. One year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and might be sterile and starts drinking again. The jealous Marylee poisons Kyle telling that his wife and Mitch are having a love affair. When Lucy finds that she is pregnant, Kyle believes that the baby belongs to Mitch and his mistrust leads to a tragedy. <br /><br />""Written on the Wind"" is an overrated melodramatic soap opera, with artificial characters and situations.

Watch 3colours blue instead.I noticed one review saying it had ripped off Alien. Like Alien didn't rip things off. The best thing about the film? The director. The worst thing about the film? The cast. Maybe it's time for the Director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent. In the meantime - well done. At least you're trying to do something.,movie
1808,"Ronald L.Davis' study of the beautiful 'Fox Girl', Linda Darnell is one written with great kindness and respect to this most wonderful lady. This book does not delve into the trash and gossip that often is cruelly and unnecessarily found in film star biographies. Davis looks at Linda with a caring pen and writes about her fairly. Although he writes about her personal troubles he does so gently with heart and understanding. He spent many hours interviewing her daughter Charlotte, her sisters Undeen and Monte, her brother Cal and numerous friends. This helps to give the book a personal feel that is not found in those written from archives and second hand news. I adored Linda before reading this book and when I finished he cemented my adoration of the Lady forever.",book
1809,"It was one of the most fascinating and intriguing books Ive ever read. There are two depths to this story and I dont mean intellectual, but rather you can decide to coast it and bounce from place to place accepting or you can pick the people you like and the ones you dont. Either way is perfectly fine, but it gives one different perspectives I beleive. I did both, choosing to side with some and dislike others but ultimately to tag along with the story and watch it. It is probably the weirdest yet most accurate thing I have ever read. The reality of it is frightening, and truthfully I hope the human society never reaches such a level. A human race laced with cold emotionless joy, nothing to fear (which is a defining factor in each of us) life carries itself it out with no point. Only a few who are considered essentially odd and one who has not been brought up in this terrifying surrounding but rather in the &quot;inferrior&quot; native culture can recognize any fault with society (which incidentally is the only reason this system works - every one is happy with it because there isnt any other way). It is almost to weird to read but its not really and if followed, it proves both margianally disatsifying but utterly rewarding.",book
1810,"This film is underrated. I loved it. It was truly sweet and heartfelt. A family who struggles but isn't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today. The film didn't make it an issue that they have little money or are Dominican Republican the way Hollywood have.<br /><br />Instead the issue is Victor is immature and needs to grow up. He does, slowly, by the film's end. He has a ways to go, but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward. His grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time. A truly heartfelt indie",movie

1813,"I read both The Tipping Point and Blink in rapid procession, I found the kooky mix of anecdotes, statistics and the startling discoveries of marketing and crowd-sourcing. Before I degrade into buzzwords, I'd like to state that Gladwell's books are entertaining but not entirely applicable to everyday life. It's no marketing textbook, but it proposes some interesting ideas as to how trends get started, and also, why companies so often fail to tap the next incoming one. But it's intriguing anyway, the chapters are light, and are fairly self-contained. Overall, I loved the book.",book
1814,"Roman Polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as Repulsion. I can't imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in Le Locataire, yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people, myself included.<br /><br />Polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise. The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there's no tangible supernatural element here. While horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis (be it cheap or more elaborate) Polanski sadistically tortures us and, if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />Suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations (alternatively fooling and fulfilling them), not literally with people's nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat, while we are forced to identify with a sole character. What's more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we, the viewers, are compelled to judge him, reject him while we have been masterfully lured (""paint 'n lure"") into being him.",movie
1815,"In her novel, The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood effectively portrays a woman's struggle to retain her power.The Handmaid's Tale describes a future in which a radical religious sect-the Sons of Jacob-has overthrown the United States government. A backlash to blas&eacute; attitudes regarding sex, this group aimed to cease the objectification of women, but only succeeded in creating a new form of objectification. The Sons of Jacob formed a caste society in which women must either ""`fulfill their biological destinies'"" (220) or be declared ""Unwomen"" (10).The novel is told from Offred's-a Handmaid's- perspective. The regime forced her from her life of freedom to become a Handmaid-""a chalice"" (286). Offred, like many women today, is too scared and unsure to defend herself. Readers easily identify with this character and cannot help but internalize Atwood's message of empowerment. The Handmaid's Tale drives home the theme of women's power with mastery.The novel is intended for women. It is told from a woman's perspective and details horrors of sexism. Atwood stretches modern antifeminist thoughts to their haunting conclusions-urging women to take a proactive stance against sexism now, before it's too late. The book's fervent message is a response to growing antifeminist attitudes in the 1980's when feminists were accused of wrecking the traditional home. Atwood wrote The Handmaid's Tale to illustrate the chilling impact of the antifeminist sentiments that women belonged at home and men are more powerful than women. These attitudes are stretched to become ""`But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence'"" (221) and ""`she shall be saved by childbearing'"" (221). The author was also influenced by the American Puritans' conservative values and the Iranian monotheocracy during the 70's and 80's. She takes these values and draws them to their logical conclusions.The book's feminist message carries through the plot, which focuses on Offred's empowerment. After being imprisoned, stripped of her name, and sent to an elite household to bear children, Offred's spirit is shattered. She is utterly powerless against the new regime, which forces her to submit to objectification or die. Every month, Offred and the Commander must perform ""The Ceremony"" (93)-a sexual act that reiterates Offred's loss of sexual power, as there is no choice, intimacy, or love involved. The Commander asks Offred to meet with him secretly to play Scrabble and to talk. As women are forbidden to read or write, and the meetings are kept secret from his wife, this lends Offred a small power. Later, the Commander dresses Offred like a whore and brings her to Jezebel's, a brothel for elite men, for ""`just another crummy power trip'"" (243). At the end of the novel, Offred must either assert herself, or fall back ""into the darkness"" (295) of her powerless state within society.I fell in love with this book on two levels-as a woman and as a reader. Atwood's fervent message of female empowerment humbled me. Previously, I regarded books like Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God as feminist. Atwood's satirical take on the matter, however, coupled with the narrator's relatable personality gave The Handmaid's Tale much more impact. Unlike Hurston's novel, this book is not clean-cut or uplifting. Its messy and despondent nature renders this tale's message more powerful. Women who read this book cannot take it lightly, but are forced to confront their own way of life. Atwood achieves her intended goal-to make the reader question and, therefore, empower herself.The questions raised by Atwood added to the imagination stimulant this novel provides. Atwood's distopian world intrigued me. The Handmaid's world is wholly imaginative, with a few connections to modern American society that ground it in reality. This odd blend of fantasy and reality forms a plausibly extrapolated distopia. Atwood's spare style enriches this world. She uses short, simple sentences such as, ""I don't need to smoke this cigarette"" (209), to create an austere and distant tone.Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is intellectually, emotionally, and imaginatively stimulating. She effectively urges women to recognize and demonstrate their own power. Atwood's work speaks for feminists everywhere when it states: ""Nolite te bastardes carborundorum...`Don't let the bastards grind you down'"" (186).",book

1818,"This movie is truly unique. It really captures the spirit of the play, but makes it entertaining to the modern generation. The romance between Tromeo and Juliet was believable, and erotic, not pulled off by many adaptations. It is also so funny I was almost crying with laughter.<br /><br />Like with most Troma its in your face, taboo subjects, gore and sex, and yet add in some really good acting and a Shakespeare plot. You really have to see this movie to believe it!<br /><br />There are some hillarious jokes in the credits (best credits I've seen since Hot Shots) loads of Troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare refs. And Lemmy from the house of Motorhead narrates. I lent this movie to a friend and had an almost impossible job of getting it back. Troma at its best, this film really is a gem, and goes in my top 5 favourite movies of all time. <br /><br />Though its not the sort of film you'd watch with your mum, and might offend some people.

1819,"I have to admit, I picked this movie just for the cast, and while Sutherland, Scacchi, and Prochnow were - as usual - great performers, the rest of the movie was such a let down. It feels like it was put together by a team of adolescents with low level scripts, that is, scripts lacking any depth, awful photography and editing, and hilariously lousy score! I can't believe I was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end... the sad thing is, this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a hit; that is, two main ingredients are there: a great story of national conspiracies, and a great core cast (even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality). But maybe I'm missing something; until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.",movie

I've also been there for Prime Rib night.  Great value and nice portion size.  They have a really nice menu and from what I understand- their burgers are also excellent.  They have several pool tables and live entertainment at least Friday and Saturday.

1822,"How this film could miss so many of the fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot, ankle-deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast swathes of noise, replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars. Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely ""plastered on"" over the cracks... Dreadful. In a world where gormless, brain-dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job (a tear appears), Get Carter (sobs uncontrollably) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently, this one takes the proverbial biscuit. Execrable nonsense. How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder... Rubbish.",movie
1823,"It' s easier to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by Star Fleet Lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.)<br /><br />Dwight Schultz is miscast as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a shallow, two dimensional figure from a soap opera. Paul Newman is also miscast as General Leslie Groves, but this movie's problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles.<br /><br />The factual errors and great liberties taken (with the chronology of events) in order to advance screenwriter Bruce Robinson's political agenda make this movie embarrassing to watch. That's probably why this movie has found a home on the so-called History Channel. <br /><br />""Fat Man and Little Boy"" combine bad science, bad history, bad screenwriting and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be viewed by impressionable high school or college students who know nothing about the Manhattan Project.",movie
1824,"I agree that, when a society begins to burn books, thereby stifling the free flow of ideas, it's a sign of facsism on the rise. But, sometimes, there are books with such awful and intolerant ideas, I begin to question (but only question) whether or not they should be burned, regardless of the threat of facsism. It would be one thing if they were just lonely books, on dusty used bookstore shelves. It's another thing if they are books with ideas that are taken seriously, with a whole history of people utilizing them in every day life.Books like ""Fascinating Womanhood"" are the reason feminsim is a necessary part of our society today. Ideas like Andelin's need to be combatted by sane, rational and tolerant thought. Andelin goes so far as to say that, if a husband has an affair, it is the wife's fault because she didn't perform her ""natural"" wifely duties. I don't care who you are, or why you believe the way you do, there is no possible way you can believe this. It's hogwash. The last thing we need in this society is women running around blaming themselves for cheating husbands.This book is full of equally hogwash ideas that deserve to be laid to rest on dusty, used bookstore shelves, and laughed at if ever discovered by young, yet impressionable, teens.

1827,"Let's begin by acknowledging that there are arguably three types of horror films: good, bad, and utterly embarrassing reels that make the entire genre suffer in every way. Dark Harvest promises big with its Artisan DVD cover, but rest assured that is where the show stops. Following a grueling opening montage, we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script, extremely under qualified (even for a beginners film) acting, disastrous lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, could no one afford anything more than a mask for the villain, or did they just think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers , so it's good enough for us? Well, it did not work at all to create a scary villain. At any rate, this is one of the movies that make you check your watch, sigh and curse your own gullibility. The timing in every scene is painful, and the entire production has a middle school feeling to it (come to think of it, I have seen better middle school stage productions, right down to the special effects). I'm trying to think of some way to end this review on a positive note, so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be donated as drink coasters, Frisbees, wind chimes.......I'd say ""go see your yourself"", but that would just be cruel.<br /><br />Check out the rest of this production company's reviews and you'll find the same for every one of their movies. They claim to honor the contract between film and audience (i.e. please the fans) but all they have done is chuckle and dumped a load on our heads for the cash (of which I am sure they saw very little for this). <br /><br />Sorry people, the high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously posted by those either directly or indirectly connected to this travesty. <br /><br />1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating.

1830,"The pros - the food is excellent. 5 stars. Of the three taco trucks on the block of Allen and Hall to Allen and Lombard this is the clear winner. Everything is great but the chorizo and chicken are clear winners in my book. The taco bowl is massive and easily two meals. The burritos are perfect sized and the hot sauce is good, not great. Haven't had the chicken dinners but they look and smell amazing. The birria was phenomenal and I ate beyond the point of fullness with no regrets. 

The cons - one star for timing and execution. I have come here about 7-8 times before writing this review so I could determine accurately how absolutely terrible they are with timing. If you walk up and order and it's busy, be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes. If you walk up to order and it's dead, be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes. If you call in an order, wait 20 minutes then go pick it up, guess what - be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes. This is a food truck and a taco truck at that - who in their right mind thinks it's acceptable to have that kind of wait time outside a sit down restaurant? If I'm really hungry I just go to Alvaros instead down the road. They still make a great taco and burrito and you get it about 8 minutes after you order.

It was so esoteric, & yet one of a handful of movies that remains with you for a long time. I am still not sure what the reality of the movie is, and perhaps, like the Uncertainty Principle, the obscurity is the definite thing. Acting is superb, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding, an overall melancholiness permeates, & yet, it is hard not to be absorbed in the story. I rented it thinking it was science fiction (it was in the sci-fi section with some totally misleading blurb), but quite clearly it is not. Or horror, or even suspense. In fact, one feels thankful the director took the courage to make a movie like this, for which obviously there is no solid audience. I know some people have complained about Klaus Kinski's short role, but I think it is very appropriate - his limited exposure is critical to the formation of the mystery of this movie.",movie

Just¬Ö Wrong! Even its success, which is unexplainable. I can understand when those crappy parody movies, like Epic Movie, make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because they're cheap (of course they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia makes 450 million dollars worldwide, you think 'what the hell is wrong with the world?'<br /><br />And to think we have Meryl Streep, one of the greatest alive actresses of the world, in it? What was she thinking? 'I need the money', she could say. Well then, sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. It's not that Meryl is good in a disastrous piece of, err, 'movie'. She's also disastrous! When she sings, even though she's got the vocals, it's ridiculous. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. He used to be James Bond. Now he's singing Abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. Really? And when I mention Abba, not that I have anything against the band and their music. Though it doesn't help them when actors started singing (badly), dancing (worse) and the extras join then (They pop out of nowhere!

1839,"In some ways, The Wrath of Kriemhild surpasses Siegfried's Death, but it also loses some of that film's greatness. The plot of this one is more cohesive than the first, which is quite amazing. The second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through, until, that is, you get to the climactic battle scenes; only the Iliad's are better. Lang and Harbou embellished the Huns. The poet-compiler of the Nibelungenlied didn't know a Hun from his right ball, and as a result they are, more or less, the same as the Burgundians in custom. For example, although the poet clearly describes Etzel as a heathen (which is Kriemhild's main concern as Rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him), when she gets to Hunland, the first thing she does is go to mass. The Huns here are clearly heathens; they're almost like caveman. The depiction of them is hilarious, especially Verbal, the jester, who has two marvelous scenes. Etzel's character has been given more weight. He is much more formidable. All he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem. Lang and Harbou are masterful at building suspense, especially at the banquet scene, which is intercut with Verbal's second performance to an amazing effect. However, as is the nature of this half of the poem, the film's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one, for the most part, except for a dazzling sequence where Etzel's hall burns down with the Nibelungs inside. The one thing I do have to object to is the way Harbou changes the ending. SPOILERS: in the poem, after Hildebrand captures Hagen and Gunther, they are imprisoned. Kriemhild visits Hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde. He refuses and she herself decapitates her brother. When Hagen still refuses, she decapitates him. Hildebrand (or possibly Dietrich) is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he, in turn, decapitates her, calling her a ""Devil Woman"". Etzel, who is much weaker in the poem than he is here, says something silly like: ""Ah me!"" I can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as Hildebrand brings them from the castle; to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic. I also understand why they didn't have Hildebrand kill Kriemhild: his character is much reduced here; his name is only mentioned once. But, to have Kriemhild kill herself, adopting Brynhild's death from the Icelandic sources, is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them. The point of the poem is that Kriemhild's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil. Here, we simply have her die for her lost love. It's not as interesting.",movie
1840,"This is probably the best and most insightful book on how the US became involved in Vietnam and has lessons for any and all subsequent administrations on the establishment of policy. The great object lesson here is that while deception is hardly praise-worthy, self deception is worse because it is just plain dumb.Much of this topic was covered initially in the classic ""The Best and the Brightest,"" but this study by BGEN McMaster provides an insightful understanding military strategy, a quality that was singularly lacking in the Kennedy or Johnson administration in the run up to Vietnam, particularly at the policy making level which was engaging in an eccentric reasoning process to determine the appropriate response.The first self deception involved the Cuban Missile Crisis and what won the day. The correct answer is that Washington and Moscow did a missile swap and concluded an agreement on the basis of common interests. MacNamara thought that graduated pressure had done the trick, but really he had no understanding of military affairs. The only thing that MacNamara understood less than military affairs was diplomacy. He believed that by gradually ramping up the response to the Vietcong and Hanoi that he could produce a settlement in which a viable South Vietnam was allowed to exist (although South Vietnam's greatest enemy was always itself). Since North Vietnam was willing to sustain all manner of losses for the sake of unification, it is not clear what this graduated response would accomplish except demonstrate weakness and a lack of resolve.Another questionable advisor was Max Taylor who trimmed his sails not to suit new realities, but new masters. Although he filled many roles, his hand in this matter was that of a careerist and courtier, not a military professional.The Joint Chiefs who were effectively sidelined from any policy making role were also culpable, but for a variety of other different reasons. While the parochialism of the various service chiefs undermined the effectiveness of JCS, there were problems that were personality driven that also limited the ability to make a meaningful contribution.General McMaster first came to my notice during Desert Storm when as a major he led a very successful engagement involving US tank forces. During Iraqi Freedom, he was the author of the notion of clear, hold, and build (which was successful implemented in the Northern portion of the Sunni triangle. Because this area was out of the field of vision of the Green Zone trolls and more importantly the Secretary of Defense and the Neo-Cons, he was wildly successful. There are few people in government service who are as impressive as General McMaster. This book is worth reading by anyone interested in military affairs.",book
1841,"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed.)The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella. Jeremy Brett is also strong,offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist Basil Hallward.Peter Firth,while not originally my vision of Dorian, handles the role with style and grace...and later with a convincing strain of cruelty. The supporting cast is equally fine, Gielgud's former 'Importance Of Being Earnest"" co-star Gwen Francon-Davies plays his philanthropic Aunt Agatha with dignity and Judi Bowker makes a touching Sybil Vane. The wit,pathos and tension of Wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen. My only other qualm is with the hair styles. Many of them seemed out of place,looking more like 1970's versions of Victorian hairdos rather than the actual style. Overall however,the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence.",movie

1843,"When I first saw ""A Cry in the Dark"", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it portrayed. When I saw it a second time in an Australian Cinema class, I realized a second point: communication issues. You see, when a dingo snatched Lindy Chamberlain's (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were grief-stricken but didn't show it. As Seventh Day Adventists, they believed that God willed this to happen, and so they couldn't mourn it. But when people all over Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone started believing that Lindy did it herself.<br /><br />The point is, the wrong message got communicated to the public, and it turned people against Lindy. Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. It may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlet's political views.<br /><br />As for the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably get blown away just by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best movies ever.",movie

1847,"Paul Janeczko compiled this ""Everyday Guide to Poetic Forms"" with wonderful ""asides"" and editorial descriptions. It is definitely not ""everyday-ish"" /or/ for children only. The book is an absolute delight - and an eye-opener. OR, perhaps I should say *ear-opener* because all the sounds of these examples make music /or/ nonsense /or/ possibly dissonance. If you are, or have ever been an editor, read the epitaph on p.40!I've asked myself why this wasn't an alternate text in English Lit 101. (Obviously because it wasn't published that long ago.) Janeczko introduces us to twenty-nine forms of poetry, and divulges that poets don't always follow the rules. There are some really tricky forms (see ROUNDEL p. 22 & DOUBLE DACTYL p.25). The latter has an outstanding example by John Hollander, especially appropriate in February, the month of Presidential obeisance. It reveals that our 23rd President, a Hoosier :~) ""didn't do much""? This is a book of lots & lots of smiles that call for sharing. The wildly unrestrained, splashy colors combine with collage for illustrations that are great fun.

1850,"Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie ""Son of the Mask."" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds ""Cuz I gotta!"" Unfortunately, that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking, ""Good Lord, Why?"" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party.<br /><br />The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery, a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous, insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home, mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is in search for his mask at the orders of his father, Odin.<br /><br />First off, ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.<br /><br />The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and what's worse, they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while, obviously computer animation was used, so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability, a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.<br /><br />The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods, or whoever, for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question ""WHY?"" The son of the Mask gets one star, although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be, in my book, the mask.",movie

1852,"Those childhood memories...when things were new, and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life.<br /><br />One of the initial memories I have from childhood is this animated program ""Galaxy Express 999,"" about a young boy named Tetsuro, who goes on a train ride around the galaxy, in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold-hearted, trophy gathering mechanical hunters. Accompanying Tetsuro on his journey is Maetel, a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago...<br /><br />Back in the early-80's, as a boy who attended kindergarten and the early years of elementary school in Seoul, South Korea, ""Galaxy Express 999"" was a phenomenally popular animated program imported from Japan, which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through life that awaited them. The memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8 to 9pm before bed time...<br /><br />Those were some wonderful memories, never to be had again...<br /><br />As I moved to America, and while residing here for over 2 decades, I sometimes wondered about that time and place, in a country thousands of miles away divided from America by an enormously vast ocean, of this childhood program, with its hit theme song, and of the boy named Tetsuro, his protective companion Maetel, the enigmatic train conductor, and of the spacefaring train Galaxy Express 999.<br /><br />Many, many years passed...<br /><br />Last summer while I was in Korea, I was able to track down a copy of the original ""Galaxy Express 999"" (1979) on DVD, and it brought back a lot of nostalgic, heartfelt memories. ""Galaxy Express 999"" remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago, opening up those nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important stepping stone for young boys who tuned in and embarked on their life's journey into manhood.<br /><br />Here's to wonderful memories.

1853,"I was planning to go with a friend, but she had a last minute emergency and couldn't make it, so I went solo. Bad decision. The place was very crowded which was understandable for a Saturday lunch, but the waiter taking names completely ignored me, and when I went up to ask for a seat for one, they didn't even get my name. 
The food was 10/10 though! I got the classy lady and the onion dog, both of which were very satisfying. As a vegan, I found plenty of options, and the speed of service was great!
However, when I paid with cash, I did not get the correct amount of change. My total was $7.73 (great value for the food), and lacking a $10, I paid $20 with 3 ones to make the change easier to calculate. But they took the $3 and only put in $20 on the receipt, so I ended up paying a whopping $13 for the meal (including tip).
Overall, a huge disappointment despite the quality of the food. Very stigmatizing for solo diners!",restaurant

1855,"Known by his contemporaries as the only social theorist to apply Darwin critically, in 1899 Thorstein Veblen published The Theory of the Leisure Class: A Economic Study of Institutions, which was to become the basis from which all further American leisure history and theory stemmed. In his study, Veblen is primarily concerned with the &quot;new rich,&quot; whom he regards as social parasites that retard the growth of modern life. Thorstein Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class from a perspective that was largely isolated from his own culture, which either aided in his understanding of the Leisure Class or perhaps negatively influenced his opinions due to his exclusion from it. In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen essentially confines man and woman's existence on the planet as a struggle to change and adapt with the growth of their communities. Through this belief, Veblen develops a theme that amounts to the idea of a certain &quot;dominant&quot; type of individual. This individual develops a social structure through dominance in which social advance is sought by others. She/he will feel the discrepancy between the modern life and traditional life during the process. Though Veblen's rhetoric is sometimes anxious, sometimes negative, he actively pursues a specific account of the origins of the Leisure Class through individuals. The struggle for individual advancement eventually expands to include society, and the more individual struggle for advancement in society leads to the accumulation of surplus goods.Surplus of conspicuous consumption by the Leisure Class gives the class license to indulge shamefully in pure conspicuous consumption, where their occupations eventually become leisure itself. These &quot;professions&quot; of the Leisure Class by nature render it closed, and impenetrable by outsiders.Thorstein Veblen wrote the Leisure Class represented the new phenomena of conspicuous consumption compared to pre-Industrialized wealthy communities as well as contemporary working-class ones. But as intellectual inquiry into the topic of leisure has progressed over the past one hundred years, leisure has come to hold a number of definitions and meanings.",book

1857,"This movie is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters are straight out of his paintings (the Death Dealer being the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art. Bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope (the technique of tracing a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. However, since the subject of the movie is quite realistic (all characters are humans), this works pretty well.<br /><br />But what I really like here is the plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences, a really hideous villain and a gorgeous babe. This movie has the feeling of the best Conan comics, not surprisingly since Roy Thomas is the writer of the Marvel series of our favourite Cimmerian! This is a far cry from the crappy live action Conan, not to speak of all the B-movie of the genre.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!",movie

Wish i could find a copy of this on a 45rpm record. Five disparate teams head out one night in L.A. for a scavenger hunt for clues instead of physical objects. An unkempt game-master with two gorgeous assistants is the mastermind of all this insanity that's about to be unleashed on L.A. All the teams are stereotypes (this movie being from 1980, before political correctness screwed everything up): the ""good guys"", the ""nerds"" led by Eddie Deezen, the dumb beer-loving ""jocks"", the ""we-don't-need-a-man-type ladies"", especially the redhead. The giggling twins are a scream, too. And finally, the ""bad guys"" with Stephen Furst as the leader. Furst is hilarious as the overweight slob Harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a gooey mess. Movies like this aren't made anymore. These days, movies have to have an ""edginess"" to them with some dark characters and other nonsense. Go back to the days when the ""good guys"" led by David Naughton were still good and not hopelessly conflicted. So dump all serious pretensions and go back to 1980. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS . . .",movie

So when I call this one of my all-time faves, it's nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time is about symbolism, not realism. It's kafkaesque (a pity Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd, when he was so good as Josef K), it's stylish, knowing, sardonic and slick. Jeff Goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters, trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily, trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others don't, whom he can outshoot and whom he can't. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball, and the supporting cast look spot-on. The symbolism, the settings (the one outdoor motion shot with Jeff Goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry), the dialogue (style, not practicality, is the order of the day), it's all about characters interacting, not really gangsterism. Fun to watch, must've been fun to do. What the critics were up to is really a mystery...",movie

1868,"Almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. From the misjudged, often incomprehensible script onwards Dr Rey builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience. Sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over-wrought, OTT and middle aged and the men are young, vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex. The director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances.<br /><br />There is certainly a great deal of 'acting' going on. Dianne Wiest slips into a pale impersonation of her Bullets Over Broadway performance and poor old Jane Birkin flounders in her attempt to give a comic performance. Though you have to pity her as there is very little real comedy here.

The subject matter is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this film will not soon be forgotten. I know I will be haunted by Gere's portrayal for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins portrayal of a serial killer has a screen portrayal terrified and so engaged me. The film opens with a shocking statistic so don't miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. Richard Gere's finest role proving the man can act.

The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this.

1884,"A must try for anyone curious about Burmese food! The restaurant is located in a very up and coming neighborhood with outdoor seating but the decor and ambiance inside is so inviting so I highly recommend sitting inside! We made a reservation but there was plenty of open seats so I am not sure a reservation was needed even on a Saturday night. We ordered the gold samosas, tamarind hot wings, chicken paratha, beef curry with coconut rice and Shan noodles.

Gold Samosas are an absolute must! The filling is delicious and filled with potatoes and the pastry is crispy and flaky. It's a texture treat for your tastebuds.

Tamarind Hot Wings were crispy as well but the meat was so juicy and tender. The sauce is a little bit sweet but has a bite to it. 

Chicken curry with paratha is another must! I love paratha. It's basically a flakier version of naan bread and is the perfect vehicle to transport the curry into your mouth. The curry is very flavorful but the chicken is the star. Tender and juicy, I was practically eating the curry by itself.

Beef curry with coconut rice was excellent too. The rice was light with a delightful coconut taste. The beef was fatty but again, very tender.

Shan noodles was my least favorite dish of the night as it was just somewhat of a filler in comparison to the other dishes. There's a lot of flavors in the dish but I think the ratio of seasoning to noodles is a bit off because we got bites of flavorless noodles even after thoroughly mixing.

Overall, a great spot to try something different and to just enjoy some hearty curry on a cold day!",restaurant

1886,"Heard so many boast about the lobster roll in and about town. Figured I'd try it since I live in town. Service was great from order to curbside pickup. The amount of lobster (mostly claw and knuckle meat ) is plenty on the hot dog roll that was buttered (tho cold) served with a very large piece of lettuce. I was so disappointed bc the lobster was bone dry..wasn't mixed or garnished with mayo, butter, nothing. I'm thinking someone filled our rolls with cut up lobster waiting to be mixed with seasonings, etc. It was simply a roll of cut up dry lobster meat..nothing else. So not worth the money..I don't get the hype. So disappointed. We really wanted to like it. Other places in Needham with lobster rolls on the menu so much better.",restaurant
1887,"I generally don't reread books. I have so many waiting in the queue (two years backlog at last count, when friends recommend a book to me I ask them to check back in 2007 to see what I thought of it) that I don't really have time to go back and read stuff that I finished years ago, no matter how much I enjoyed it. And yet here I am, going through the famed trilogy again. I first read LOTR when I was about ten years old and while many of the finer details were absent from my memory, I managed enough of a general gist of the books to avoid going back to them, even resisting the urge when the movies came out to dive into a reread frenzy, even as the rest of my friends were tearing through them (plus I had a certain satisfaction, having gotten to them years before, first on the block syndrome and all that). And I did successfully resist through the three years of movie releases. But when I saw the extended version of the final movie, I was struck by a few scenes that I didn't remember that clearly, as well as reading some articles on the differences between the books and the movies, what was left in, left out, changed, etc. With all that in mind, I figured it was worth a shot to go through the books again, with an adult mind (in theory), since I don't know if I appreciated them enough as a kid. Of course, there was also a risk I would find them tedious and dull and just ruin all the magic but it was one I was willing to take. And it turned out to be a good idea. I firmly believe the reason Middle-Earth has remained stuck in everyone's consciousness over the years was because Tolkien treated it like a real place, made it a living, breathing world, down to the nuts and bolts of its history and as such it almost became a place you wanted to live. I've never encountered a made up place that feels as solid as Tolkien's creation does. That said, Fellowship of the Ring is interesting but also acts as setup, putting everything in place for the events that would happen in later volumes. The pace is far slower than I remembered, when I reached page two hundred and they hadn't left the Shire I knew I was in for a long haul. But you know what? I barely noticed. All the templates of modern epic fantasy are here and done right, by contrasting the average lives of the ""little people"" with the actions of the big important immortal people and mixing them all together, he really creates a world shaking feel, that big events are just around the corner and going to change everything. His writing has a casual ease to it, sure everyone speaks in stilted fantasy dialogue but it reads easy and the going went much faster than I would have thought. His gift for description is amazing, he relates enough to develop a sense of wonder but doesn't bog down the proceedings by describing every leaf and blade of grass. Those looking for action will probably be sorely disappointed, as will those looking for women characters (saving the world was man's work apparently, but it was a different time, kids) and yes, if you boil it down to the basics, you can summarize it, in the words of my brother so many years ago, as ""all they do is walk around!"" True, in a sense, but it's how they do it that matters and if you let yourself be immersed in the epic sweep of affairs, you'll be walking right along with them. The movie is what it is, and was a great experience, but they had to cut corners, literally transferring this novel to screen, as much as it alarmed purists would have made a dull movie. So think of the movie as the Cliffs Notes version of the book, I heartily recommend both, but if you want the full effect, the text is the way to go. This will be one reread I won't regret.",book

1889,"In ""Hoot"", a new kid arrives to Florida from Montana. He first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully. Soon, though, he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town, right where a number of burrowing owls live. This movie has the look of a family film, but it is pretty more radical than it seems, as it shows sympathetically how Roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking (including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants) in the name of environmentalism (to save owls, no less). Now, one might agree or not with those actions, but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions. A good, solid film, all in all.",movie
1890,I've been searching all over ATL for good Birriaqueso tacos and I FINALLY found a place that's meets my expectations. I ordered through grub hub and picked it up.

1892,"It's about time an American book in english came out on this subject, authored by people who know what they're talking about and thankfully NOT including tin and wind-up robots from the 60s and earlier. This little paperback is what chogokin collectors would humorously refer to as ""robot porn."" It's a glossy, high-quality picture book that causes salivation and drooling with the turn of every page. Unfortunately it is by no means a complete encyclopedic manual for all toys diecast during the 70s and 80s, but that can't be expected, considering such an undertaking would produce a book (or morelike a series of books) far heftier than this little paperback. Since that expectation is unreasonable, it is entirely forgivable since this little tome covers quite a chunk of the chogokin, vinyl and plastic market, and a nice variety, as well.First off the book construction is sweet - small and easily handled, it's like a mini coffeetable book with a glossy softcover. I wasn't expecting such a nicely made little book. There is minimal chitchat and all the talent is poured into the photography of the most mint-looking chogokin robots I have ever seen. I think the thing that I was most tickled about was there was a picture of a mint Tetsujin 28 in the front of the book, and a beat up, played-with, broken and paintchipped version of the same robot in the back of the book. The wear on the used robot shows more as a sign of how much that toy was loved, not abused, and anyone who loves collecting chogokin, I think, would get the same tingly warm feeling looking at that beat Tetsujin 28 as the shiny minty one.There are a few vinyl robots included in the line-up, and I could think of quite a few chogokin that were left out that could've taken up the pages of the vinyls, as I'm not much of a vinyl collector myself; vinyls are a whole other collector market and I can see why they were included in the book, but then again, I would've preferred that they weren't. Vinyls were usually monsters, but the ones that depict robots were the ones focussed on. All in all they don't take up a lot of space. Also the book is an almost even mix between the comical/humorous chogokin like Robocon and Robodachi and the more serious robot gladiators and team robots like the Godaikins; again these are (more or less) two different collector markets and not everyone collects both. As well, there are some Giant Machinders included, which is not even a scratch on the surface for them since there are quite literally hundreds if not more to collect in that category, but this book is really not meant to be a catalogued record of every robot ever made. Even though one will be able to think of some robots that were left out, all the major ones were included. The only complaint I have is that a lot of them are shown not holding a weapon, when many of them are known for their specific or characteristic weapon(s). Some are shown with a weapon, like Garbin, but too many are just robots standing weaponless. Again, though, this book isn't meant to be an official catalogue, so don't expect accessories to be featured.If you want lists and cataloging of every robot ever made during the 70s and 80s, there are plenty of online sites that attempt to accomplish such a massive undertaking. But if you want to flip through a nice hefty little book just to get the tingly warm feeling of joy gazing upon the robots of your childhood, this book is totally worth it. It's a little window peephole into the past, but man is it worth peeping.",book

I wanted ketchup and mayo but she never came around to even be able to ask for it. Never came to see if we need a refill or anything else for that matter. We waited for a check nothing. I had to get up myself and look for a manager. I spoke with the owner of the restaurant who was extremely dismissive. I started to explain to him what was going on and when I told him that the burger came out wrong the second time around he disagreed with me because he said he made it.

True to his word, the dreams that Wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin' hot schoolgirls - but the dreams come with a price that's more than money. The sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, blackmails Wong out of his cash and business, kills his family, and eventually kills Wong himself...Wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on, and eventually finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil sorcerer - but as it turns out - Wong's brother is a pretty dope-ass sorcerer himself, and with the help of the sorcerer's abused wife - turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemes...<br /><br />EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the more enjoyable CATIII films I've seen in a while. Absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other CATIII entries like RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter, is more ""fun"" then some of the more serious films of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more ""carefree"" CATIII entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore, without being overly comedic either. Definitely worth a look, especially to the genre enthusiast. 8/10",movie
1897,"It first must be said that I truly did enjoy this book. I found it a fascinating read, and I tend to like most forms of fairy tale disection. This was purchased for me as a source of inspiration for my own writing. In that vein, the book was most inspiring and helped to analyze different aspects of fairy tales. The writing is quite strong, and few can argue the importance of allowing children in our already violent world to read these classic stories.Really, when not taken to be fairy tale or research doctrine, this is a fine read for those who like to ponder fairy tales.But after a little research, the author, if not his material, might not have the qualifications to report these thoughts as any more than musings from a bit of research dabble. Which leads to the question... is this a problem that can be shrugged away, or should there be more impressive credentials behind a book claiming such magnitude.Me, I prefer to think of as equivalent to the work of a grad student. Fascinating, researched and thoughtful enough, but to be taken with some salt.What this book does offer is a truly interesting way to think about fairy tales. Is their timelessness due to human similarities? What might be the subconscious appeal?It's a great piece to read, if it offers nothing else.",book

1900,"This is a huge book 11x9 and shy 900 pages. The cover says over 600,000 copies have been sold but I bet its millions by now. When I first ordered the book I assumed it would be good, but its better than good. As a real homesteader I recommend this book for a variety of reason.The chapters are long and thorough. Choosing to Buy Land and the chapters on Resources for Back to the Basics, Living Simply, Health Matters and Living Simply are excellent. Because in the buying land section which is long she covers everything from can you get a job near by if you need to still work, can you do with your land what you want, how do you know if the land is fertile, and the wheel and deal aspects involved. Knowing if the land is fertile is a must for anyone who wants to be fully self sufficient since growing food is a top priority.Being able to do what you wish with your land is also important, because there are places where if you want to use a stream that runs thru your property to harness water generated power, or you want to cull trees, you have to get permits. Same with wanting to add an addition onto your abode. Some places demand you get a permit while others will let you build with the understanding that when you sell, the place is sold 'as is'.Her food section is humongous and covers everything from seeds to growing the garden to preserving what you grow either in a cellar, or by canning, freezing or drying. She has information galore on predators, insects and snakes. Barns and fences, which is important because I know first hand what a poor fence job or poor animal shelter will do when it comes to animals getting in or out.She has a huge section on poultry as well as goats cows, home dairying, bees, rabbits and pigs. And what is involved with birth to butchering. Speaking as someone who has had chickens for decades, and have consumed my fair share of home grown milk and meat, knowing what is involved in growing quality animals will save you lots of money in the end. Not to mention the home grown item tastes so much better than commercially grown animals. And knowing what is involved, what tools you will need when it comes time to cull or slaughter an animal is a must if the job is to be done humanely, safely and well.She also has an important section on caring for your own dead. Don't wince! This is very important and is a natural life process. And knowing how to deal with the local authorities as far as burying a loved one on ones own property is very important. I speak of this as a widow. Caring for ones own dead isn't as hard or creepy as one thinks. Same with knowing how to handle a birth at home. On page 35 as an example she also writes about how to bath under primitive conditions, which is what we have to do here in the Sierras when the power goes out due to snow.",book

My best friend went to the bathroom, while peeing a guy decided to shoot a video of him from the stall next door...never asked for consent, never even realized that my friend saw it all happen. Like anyone else would have reacted. He yelled for him to pull out his phone and delete the video. Of course, the guy didn't and they called the bouncers and kicked my friend out considering him a drunk. The same guys that we have been buying drinks from failed to recognize that this wasn't a case of kicking out someone from the bathroom instead it was a situation that merited a police officer report. 

After talking to not just one ""manager"" but four, the guys sent us to the police officer that was standing outside of the bar and said, ""there is the cop, you want something done you can do it yourself."" 

This should not be tolerated. Taking advantage of someone in a bathroom stall should not take place, not supporting the victim increases the chances of the issue happening again.

This is probably a good thing, as those few shots they DO show of space are depressingly silly. You will probably cry during those moments, especially upon seeing that swirling ""space ship"", which looks about three inches long.<br /><br />Nothing is felt for any of the characters, not because they are convicts or have no personality, but because they are in serious need of acting lessons, except for Billy Dee Williams who really does look depressed and at a loss, probably by being in this work...<br /><br />This is one of those movies that, when viewed with friends, is going to cause some extremely ""loud"" silences, especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one-liners (including the line about French-kissing a meteor...? Did I hear that right? Perhaps not...)<br /><br />The original virtual reality girls get ""killed"", which means nothing, as they are not even real to begin with. Well, the other ""characters"" aren't, either, but that's beside the point. Haha.<br /><br />What's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull-horror-alien looking thing (green filter added on top of that, to give it more of a...uh...green look), which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot.<br /><br />Another odd deal I noticed. Whenever there is an explosion (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes highly pixelated. I don't mean a LITTLE pixelated, I mean HUGE blocks about 1/16th the size of the screen. Wow.",movie
1921,The book I read was Harry Potter and the Socerers StoneBy J.K. Rowling. this book is about a boy named Harry Potter. His partents are dead and he lives with his Aunt and Uncle Durley.On his eleventh birthday he found out that his parents went to school at Hogwarts school of Witch Craft and Wizardry and that he was a wizard. This book was a vry adventurous and exciting book.It was also very entertaining.I really loved it! Also my favorite part was the entire book!To find out more about Hogwarts Witch Craft and Wizardry read Harry Potter and the Socerers Stone. I bet you would love as much as I did!,book
1922,"I ordered here last week and I will never forget the pizza or wings I had because neither were very good. I don't even like leaving bad reviews but I felt sick after eating here and wanted to save someone the disappointment I felt ordering here. This place is quite close to me and i was on the hunt for a good local pizza spot (that isn't a larger chain) and figured I would give this place a try. I ordered over the phone (mistake number 1) and although it wasn't bad, the woman who took my order out my address in wrong (even though I repeated it 4 times.) once I sorted things with the driver I received my food, it was still hot so no complaints there, however, the best part of my meal was the Drink I had to go with it. The pizza (just a normal cheese, well done) did not taste well, the cheese taste like unseasoned mozzarella on plain tomato sauce. The wings I got along with it ( medium flavor with blue cheese) were not good either. I was unsure if they were even cooked fully but they did not have nearly enough sauce, and I was given ranch instead of the blue cheese. I ended up only having one slice of pizza, and 2 of the wings before feeling sick from it and throwing the rest away unfortunately. The last thing I want to do is waste food amidst a pandemic. 1/5 would not recommend.",restaurant

1924,"Although the concept of a 32 year old woman portraying a 12 year old girl might be a stretch for today's <br /><br />sophisticated audiences,in the 1920's this was what the fans of Mary Pickford desired and expected from their favorite star. The opening scene displays Annie's tomboyish character as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in comic ""battle"" with a rival group. The sight of a young girl being socked in the jaw and kicked may be a bit crude, but the scene is played in such an ""Our Gang"" fashion that it would be hard to take any of this seriously. Anyway, Annie can dish it out as well as take it. Once Annie returns to her tenement home and replaces her street duds with more girlish attire, it becomes more difficult (especially in close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street urchin. However, for those who can muster the required suspension of disbelief, the rest of the movie has it's rewards. Vacillating between comedy (Annie's gang puts on a show) to sentiment (Annie plans a birthday surprise for her Irish policeman father) to tragedy (her father is killed on his birthday), the film gives Mary ample opportunity to display a range of emotions that would please her fans of any era. <br /><br />Of course the requisite ""happy ending"" is eventually achieved; the evildoers are apprehended with the help of Annie's friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her pals riding down a busy thoroughfare on a sunny day. Which is a good a way as any for a Mary Pickford movie to end. <br /><br />",movie
1925,"There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail depicts a truly great event in Australian Military history the brave defence of Australia against the cruel barbaric Japanese Army.Howver this film fails to take into account the story of the ""Fuzzy Wuzzy's"" or the New Guinea natives that The Australians used to help them carry out there military operations. The film also fails to give a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behaviour in this event. It is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was like.<br /><br />Again the Australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in Australia';s history the film it deserved. This is film making at its worst with arbitrary cinematography , bad scripting and dialogue , no character development and clich√© jungle warfare scenes.<br /><br />It fails to imbue the audience in any meaningful perspective other than the Japanese Army were ruthless and cruel murderers of an ill-equipped and badly trained group of Australians fighting in a jungle.<br /><br />The film failed as most Australian films do to attract a significant Australian audience in fact they stayed away in droves.<br /><br />I am not going to join the usual parochial garbage of saying its great because its an Australian film. I say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how. This government funded film is just another failure by Australia's wealthy and spoilt rich kids.<br /><br />I am giving it zero stars because its an insult to the descendants of these truly great Australians and their enormous sacrifice.

1926,"The first word i can find to describe this movie is Awful.<br /><br />This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all is the plot a very thin plot (Wont comment further on this part) and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following. This makes the movie so bad, because you know whats going to happen. Secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. One of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: WHAT THE HELL ARE THE KIDS DOING IN THAT CORN!!!!!!!!!! Thirdly is the characters very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sorry actors. They are bad as they can be.<br /><br />The last thing that make this movie bad, is that its a horror movie. You are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks, but you are not scared, you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen.<br /><br />Conclusion: The movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants! I hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary, the movie is best unseen.",movie

Saddam Hussein features greatly in this book (at least he's often referred to, though never given a voice),since he's been dead for quite some time it's hard to ""go there"" now.I do love reading Rosenberg however, because you know you won't come across random bad language.

1930,"The Communist Manifesto was, is, and always will be the Bible of the left, no matter how many millions have died, are dying, and will die at the hands of nations that worship piously at Marx's altar. When will the left finally be satiated? When will their blood lust finally succumb to pangs of conscience? Or is it as it was with Stalin and Hitler, the more blood spilt, the more one becomes committed to the cause. When will the left realize that there is essentially no difference between the totalitarianism of the communist and the fascist? Both communist and fascist hold the state sacrosanct, and an individual's worth is determined only by how well he/she conforms in faithful servitude. How many more must be sacrificed to &quot;the good of the state&quot; before the Left starts to question its religion?There is absolutely no empirical evidence to support Marx's notion of the Labor Theory of Value. Of course there are more ingredients in determining a nation's or a corporation's wealth generative power than labor; i.e. land, capital, entrepreneurial ability. The scientific method demands testing of hypotheses. Marxism has been tested for nearly 100 years, with nary a success to point to, in fact every experiment has met with colossal failure in terms of economic ruin and human suffering. Economic success and Marxism have about as much in common as the standard of living in the U.S. compared to that of Russia.For all the intellectually bankrupt that argue, ""Marxism has not succeeded because it has not really been tried,'' consider this. Which country has put forth more of a concerted effort to adopt Marxist ideals, which country has tried its level best to adopt economic policy more in line to that espoused by the Communist Manifesto: U.S. or Russia? Japan or China? Kenya or Tanzania? Puerto Rico or Cuba? Namibia or Angola? Hong Kong or Viet Nam? West Germany or East Germany? In every instance, the national economic conditions as well as the standard of living is immeasurably better in the non-Marxist country. Yet, no matter the size of the ever growing mountain of evidence refuting the claims of Marx, those of the left continue to cling to their faith. The left continues to turn a blind eye to the evidence of failure and a deaf ear to the cries of the oppressed. The left continues to place a blind faith in the bible of blood, the Communist Manifesto.",book
1931,"Daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright. Except in this case it doesn't. Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas, (he wrote ""The Robe""), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra.<br /><br />Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight. To make amends he takes up medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (No, it sin't quite that daft; he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy). In between times, they fall in love.<br /><br />Try as I might I can't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of American mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of Sirk's films, (this one isn't too deep). On the plus side Rock Hudson isn't half bad, (I think I am rediscovering him), and, of course, it looks great, (in Sirk's films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals). Nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap-opera terms this is definitely daytime TV.",movie
1932,"Richard Dix is a big, not very nice industrialist, who has nearly worked himself to death. If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? Well, he'll likely be better off if he disregards the VOICE OF THE WHISTLER.<br /><br />This William Castle directed entry has some great moments (the introduction and the depiction of Richard Dix's life through newsreel a la Citizen Kane), and some intriguing plotting in the final reels. Dix's performance is generally pretty good. But, unfortunately, the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. Also, the movie veers from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />This is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role.",movie

My mouth was watering in anticipation for my food the whole walk back. I got a Walnut Chorizo Tortuga, which was flavorful and quite filling. The tortilla on the outside was my favorite part. It was crispy and buttery and delicious. For dessert I got a brownie and I was not disappointed. It was almost as big as the Tortuga!

1937,"After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad that I wasn't the only person left confused, especially by the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him. I anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior...naturally I assumed he had something to do with the evil goings-on at the house, but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse (hereafter referred to as Zombie #1), these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if someone out there knows why Carradine kept climbing down into graves -- let the rest of us in on it!! <br /><br />All the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so I'll attempt a synopsis. John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is throttled by Zombie #1. So far, so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard, discover Carradine's dead body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from whence Zombie #1 had emerged, but Ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie #2! Yeah, I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead all-along (a witch?), but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting-flesh version by flying into Zombie #1's grave is never explained. (Considering how excruciatingly slow-moving these zombies are, I'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his ""normal"" form until his business was concluded). This scene also brings a question to mind -- just who the heck IS Zombie #1 ??? We can only assume Zombie #1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits, but who knows which one, nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew.<br /><br />Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie #2 shambling through the trees as we saw for Zombie #1. (This leads to momentary confusion over just how MANY zombies there really are). Then in best 1950's horror-movie fashion Ireland manages to trip while fleeing. He conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (wasn't that nice of John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?)<br /><br />Meanwhile, Zombie #1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house. He easily dispatches three film-crew members, then starts up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him, and thinking it's lover John Ireland back from his night-shoot, goes out. Upon seeing it's only Zombie #1, she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves Ireland's revolver. While starlet Carole Wells is showering at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom) does. Taking his sweet time (and only after some more swigs from his hip-flask) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are to screams and gunshots). Domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready, but mistakes Macauley for Zombie #1 and shoots him six times! He does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrified Domergue backs up, right into the waiting arms of Zombie #1.<br /><br />Carole Wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and Domergue's screams; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate. So during this time Zombie #1 has time to string Domergue up from the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's hanging corpse and faints dead-away. The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house (???) -- but more on that later. Meantime, Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers Zombie #1's bloody carnage. Though Ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! Mercifully for him (and the audience), Zombie #1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor. That's the last we see of Zombie #1. At this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones ""mirror"" the old ones. How profound.<br /><br />Zombie #2, meanwhile, has gotten near the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January) where he happens to see Carole Wells floating by in a stream, and fishes her out. How did she get there? Did Zombie #1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub, so Wells has to drown too (but why outside in a stream, instead of in the tub, is never explained). Zombie #2 never makes it into the house himself (everyone's dead by now, anyways, thanks to Zombie #1) but instead he carries Carol Wells back to the graveyard. As the end credits flash on screen, we see Zombie #2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave.<br /><br />The viewer is left wondering: Yes, but wasn't this Zombie #1's grave? Why is Zombie #2 taking up residence? And what if Zombie #1 comes along and wants to climb back in -- is Zombie #2 gonna let him, or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells? And what about now-dead John Carradine -- where's he gonna stay? After all, from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave... If this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused, don't worry cause you're not alone.",movie
1938,"this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever, i laughed so much my ribs began to ache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'.",movie

The reader is always aware of two time periods: the present Cal telling the story and his life unfolding during narration and, in the beginning the story of his family, while later in the novel the second time period is Cal's childhood.I recommend this book if you have the time to devote to reading it, the intellegence to comprehend the wonderful literary techniques and vocabulary, and the trust in the author to deliver a brilliant story.

When all of this turned out to be false,Irving was accused of perjury & spent several years behind bars (although always admitting his findings were accurate). Flash forward to 20001,several months prior to September 11th, a book,entitled 'Forbidden Love' (published in the U.S. as 'Honor Lost:Love And Death In Modern Day Jordan') by a previously unknown author by the name of Norma Khouri,a woman from Jordan,who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend Dalia,due to the fact that Dalia,being from a devout Muslim background,was dating a Christian man. It,like Irving's biography on Hughes was revealed as a potential hoax. Australian film maker,Anna Broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was Khouri's attempts to clear herself of the lie(s).

Interview footage with those who know/knew her (including an ex husband,her publisher,and others) tell their side of the story.

1943,"Tom Hanks has been in such hit movies as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles have been good guys that we cheer for. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivanis a little bit different.<br /><br />In Sam Mendes' film Road to Perdition based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What is different about this little road trip is that Sullivan is a hit-man who is now being hunted by his former partner. His boss or ex-boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him almost more than his own son, Sullivan's partner Connor (Daniel Craig).<br /><br />After a job done the wrong way because of Connor, the only witness to his mistake are Sullivan and his son who wasn't supposed to be there. So Connor tries to take out Sullivan and his family, but only gets the wife and other son Peter. Sullivan outsmarts the hit and rushes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table...just sitting. With his wife and child dead, Sullivan takes to the road to find answers.<br /><br />The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid, and for Michael who feels like he is to blame for all this. He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a terrific job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile. His loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town, leaving nothing behind him.<br /><br />Mendes' previous hit film was American Beauty which received five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. This film didn't do nearly as well at the Oscars only winning one award for best cinematography but receiving five other nominations for music, sound, and a Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Paul Newman. This picture is a great story that takes you on a ride through the Midwest and into the legend of Mike Sullivan: husband, hit-man, and devoted father.

A and B then fall in love and wonder (at great length) whether to have an affair themselves).<br /><br />This is Cantonese Visconti. Story there is none, but what you DO get is a succession of wonderful images and poignantly trivial music which convey the slow passage of the central characters' emotions. There is also the chance to see one of the world's most beautiful women in a succession of stunningly elegant outfits. For my money, it's worth seeing for that alone.

The thing is, though, the movie (and its makers) decided that it wasn't going to be made fun of. Instead, it was going to try its best to be a good movie.<br /><br />And you know what? It came awfully close. A little less cheese in the incidental music, a little more professionalism in the photography, the acting, the incidentals (like the props--love the Best Buy bag)...well, it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty neat little movie on its own. And the acting, writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than I would have expected. There's even some decent humor, as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead.<br /><br />If you can overlook the low budget (which leaves its fingerprints in everything, alas) and the almost constant profanity, this can be a pretty fun time at the movies. No, it ain't great. Yes, it could have been better. But the makers, the actors, the crew, they all tried to make a good film (instead of a camp classic) and that counts for a lot.

1955,"For the student of U.S. military history and battle tactics, this book is invaluable. Every battle fought by American forces from the Colonial Wars of 1758 through Korea (in my edition) is reviewed with a tightly worded, fully descriptive and reasonably objective narrative on the page next to the map of the battle. Combat units are broken down with clear unit designations and movement lines indicating disposition. While the maps are not topographic, they do indicate terrain features which help the reader understand the impact terrain had on a particular battle's outcome.Our military history study group finds the text and maps easy to follow and interpret. While many books go into greater depth on any given battle (i.e., leadership, morale, logistics, the political environment, etc.), they lack sufficient maps that illustrate various troop movements at specific times during the engagement. This book solves that problem and does so brilliantly.",book
1956,"In my opinion, A GUY THING is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic, and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to-be sexy cousin-in-law. If you ask me, they lit up the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the performances were top grade, the direction was flawless, the production design was nice, the casting was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, to anyone who's a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughs and thrills, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",movie

1958,"Largely forgettable monster film from the 50s features truly awful special effects -- the ""claw"" in question is a giant puppet that would make Jim Henson want to kill himself. I just saw the movie last Thursday and I can't even tell you who was in it. That's a bad sign. I'm told that when the movie premiered audiences laughed it off the screen.... and that was in the 50s when standards in special effects were much lower. Basically I should have walked out of the theater as soon as the words ""produced by Sam Katzman"" came on the screen if I knew what was good for me, but then I sat through ""Harum Scarum"" also so I guess I deserve it.",movie
1959,"In this horrible attempt at a Blair Witch mockumentary, a bunch of people go to Africa to investigate a creature called the Half-Caste. It's pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of, and that everything was improvised. That can work if you have good actors, which this film didn't. <br /><br />This movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do ""quirky African stuff"" like eating elephant dung. There is also some pretty good footage of lions eating (from a National Geographic perspective) but there's not a single scare in the whole movie. <br /><br />If you've seen Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie will hold no surprises for you, and you can probably watch better lion footage on the Discovery Channel.<br /><br />Definitely a Half- Aste effort. <br /><br />A note to the filmmakers: guys, do us all a favor and next time save the ""How I spent my African Vacation"" home movie for your family and close friends. Nobody else wants to see it.",movie
1960,"Would be promising if it were a student film. Never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film. As a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. There's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely. Characters are barely sketched, which could be OK, but they're completely uninteresting. It's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical. Weakest moment: when ""the boss"" sits down to give some incoherent advice.",movie

1962,"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION wonderfully synthesizes Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little ""rough"" in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique ""sense of place"" to each of the scenes. Beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's FAR superior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might not be the most ""technically proficient"" animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional ""fantasy"" motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and JRR Tolkien then this film is a must see.",movie

1964,"The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here. Two of those things were singing and dancing. Another was a short, interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds off The Depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's successful films.<br /><br />This film achieved none of the above, despite the star presences of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring, and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you didn't get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants. I guess they learned after this movie.",movie
1965,"&quot;In Favour of Circumcision&quot; by Brian Morris is one of the most important additions to the literature on circumcision published during the past decade.As a noted scientific researcher in the medical field, Dr. Morris has the benefit that the experience of many years of active research brings with it. As a scientist he is also able to judge the merits of the scientific works of others. The book is based on the research contained in many medical papers that have been published in various highly respected medical journals. What makes the book so worthwhile is the fact that it contains up-to-date information and facts. These are presented in a clear, easy to read and - unbiased - manner, which can unfortunately not be said of many of the publications distributed by people belonging to the anti-circumcision lobby.In addition to the medical information, the book also contains a very interesting and revealing chapter on the anti-circumcision movement, pointing out their tactics and tendency to often twist medical facts to suit their own needs. Another valuable chapter contains the personal testimonies of men around the world.To summarize: this is a very valuable book, and a must-read for anyone who is interested in unbiased scientifically based facts. The anti-circumcision lobby is probably not going to like it, since it refutes many of their claims!! Together with the book of Weiss and Harter it provides a welcome source of information about a topic that has been the target of a lot of misinformation and lies in the past. Do read it!!",book

He is of a race called the Familiar and arrives in Lilac's life as a cat, at least that's how it starts. From there on his destiny takes a new turn. She is of an age of nearly non existant sexual experience for single women, facing a Rake in Regency terms, but much more than any ordinary Rake.

1967,"Abysmal Indonesian action film from legendary Arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future Cinemax pap like 'China O'Brien' and 'Do or Die' with Erik Estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star Pat O'Brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair-styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet. This guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme Mark Gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to Chris Mitchum as ""Tom Selick."" Powerful. At least the action is mindless and non-stop with some daring Asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and/or meth addicts with no concept of reality. One poor extra gets gorno-ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. Classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as, ""I would rather trust a rattlesnake!"" are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. Random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. Movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10",movie

I also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a great step up from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a great website which is worth checking out.

Every moment crackles with a steadily-growing tension, climaxing in a truly, memorable movie-going experience. If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it! The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.<br /><br />An ultimate indictment of our society's increasing morbidity, and self-sickening hunger for the next big thrill.<br /><br />A film not easily forgotten.

1976,"Director / writer Michael Winner's feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film (although still schlock efficiently catered for), which really does by go unnoticed. Sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period, but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material (of good vs. evil) and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive, if somewhat exploitative set-pieces. As a whole it's sketchy, however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang-busters with the scares. Actually there's always something going on amongst its busy framework, but it's rather down-played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring, up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation. Winner's dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian, however it's the ensemble cast that really holds it together¬Ö as you try to spot the faces. There's plenty too. Some having more to do with the scheme of things than others, but there's no doubts every one of them are committed, despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all. It's interesting to see names like Sylvia Miles (who's significantly creepy!), Beverly D'Angelo (likewise), Deborah Raffin, Eli Wallach, Christopher Walken, William Hickey (a neat cameo), Jeff Goldblum, Jerry Orbach and Tom Berenger in bit parts. Then you got a mild-mannered Chris Sarandon and movingly gorgeous Cristina Raines in the leads. Offering able support Jos√© Ferrer, Martin Balsam, Ava Gardner, John Carradine, Burgess Meredith and Arthur Kennedy. The script does throw around many characters, as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in. However it's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what's really going on here. Is there a reason for all of this, and why is it surrounding Raines' character? The emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle, as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange/worrying experiences she encounters when she's moves into her new apartment. This is where Winner tries to pull out the eerie shades, which projects some icy moments. Gil Melle was the man responsible for the grand, overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and Richard C. Kratina instruments the sweeping, scope-like photography.",movie

1980,"I haven't seen any other films by Antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of his works. Maybe if I had seen other stuff by him I would have enjoyed this one, knowing what to expect. <br /><br />I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting, deep issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues. The scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It is not only that it is slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice Or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging or the story so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag endlessly, and the relationship between John Malkovich's ""reality"" and the love stories ""fiction"" is at times fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.",movie

1985,"Babette's Feast, for me, is about healing: mending the schism between spirit and body in orthodox Christianity. This puritanical community in remote Denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of God's gifts in creation. They have taken the dualism of St. Paul to an extreme, and stress the life of the ""spirit,"" not the life of the ""flesh."" Both elderly sisters, in their youth, were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They, and their parishioners, cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader, and the sisters' father. The aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome, and the sisters don't know what to do. Enter Babette, a French stranger, and someone to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry, dusty theology. Babette will give everything she has, and in the process, will teach the sisters and their flock about grace, about sacrifice, about how sensual experience (as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist) can change lives, and about why true art moves us so deeply. When they can forgive each other, and themselves, they can focus on God's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present. As a minister, and an artist, I can't recommend a movie more highly. True art and true grace!!",movie

But I, like many women, do not like him. That is the problem. How many times has a couple quit going to counseling because one spouse did not like the counselor? You hear it all the time. It's a problem and if he wants to strengthen marriages then he needs to be impartial or he loses the women all together. If he loses women and their support for his doctrine based on scripture then he IS NOT helping people with their marriage. He really isn't showing Christ like love towards women and it's sad, because so many men are so happy to have their feelings put into words for them that they don't realize that he is also leading them down an unloving path. All the while, he tells men to be loving. Ironic, isn't it?",book
1988,"First, there is NO way the remake can be as good, because Japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a major part in this film, as explained in the opening narration. It adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie. There is slew of different supporting characters/personalities. Each does there part in making this movie wonderful. This movie is full of comedy that isn't vulgar in anyway like most of today's ""gross-out comedies."" Yet it can still have you laughing out loud. The reality is, in real life, you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with...etc. This movie truly emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences. Not to mention, it makes for a great sub-plot and much of the humor. This is a story about dance that actually has a story, and a good one at that. There are a few back stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main storyline. Truly a well written film. The dancing is great, too. I happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort, for that aspect. However, this movie goes beyond any other with dance, in the fact that, it is a story First and just happens to be written about dancing in Japanse society.

1990,"This collection of the four canonical gospels plus the Gospel of Thomas (all newly translated) is the fruit of several years of research and discussion by the Jesus Seminar, a group of scholars brought together to disseminate the gospels in order to discover the ""historical"" Jesus over and against the ""Jesus of faith"". The book can be summarized as comprising three features: An introduction to historical criticism of the gospels, with a rundown and explanation of the rules followed by the Jesus Seminar in order to discover which words were actually spoken by Jesus; the translations themselves; and the running commentary explaining the reasoning behind each decision.The introduction is accessible and informative. Generally, the claims made are not sensational in the sense that many of the Seminar's critics would make out. However, it is here that they reveal their working assumptions, and I cannot overstate how misconceived these assumptions are. It is not that they are entirely unfounded, but rather they are half-truths turned into hard-and-fast rules which when applied can only mislead. For example, members of the Seminar observe that Jesus' sayings often cut across the religious and political grain. Therefore, one of the rules becomes (unjustifiably): Jesus only ever said things that cut across the religious and social grain. The result: Jesus is gagged. He is simply not allowed to say anything in agreement with the religion or politics of his day. Therefore, he never quoted Scripture. If it isn't radical, new or totally out-of-step with the culture, Jesus didn't say it.The reasoning is all circular. How shall we resist concluding that all the Jesus Seminar's findings were determined from the very start? They begin with the assumption that Jesus never spoke in anything but parables or aphorisms (or at least that it is impossible for anything more than that to have survived oral transmission), that he never said anything that agreed with the religion or politics of his day, that he never initiated dialogue or debate, and that he never spoke about a coming kingdom (just four of the many rules). How do we know he didn't do any of these things? Well, the Jesus Seminar's research proves it, of course! How does it prove it? By assuming all these things in the first place, and rejecting anything that doesn't conform.The actual translation is rendered as casually as possible, in an attempt to reflect adequately each of the evangelists' unique styles. The principle they follow is a good translation shouldn't sound like a translation at all. Unfortunately, they shoot themselves in the foot, for the language and phraseology employed frequently sounds ridiculously crass, and we are painfully aware that we are reading a translation, and at times a very bad one, akin to reading one of those evangelical paraphrases that were so popular in the seventies.The system for distinguishing the words of Jesus from later fabrications and additions is by means of four different typefaces: red (Jesus said this, or something quite like it); pink (Jesus probably said this, or something like it); grey (Jesus probably didn't say this); black (Jesus did not say this). The idea is, of course, borrowed from red-letter editions of the Bible, in which all the words (supposedly) spoken by Jesus are in red. Alongside the text is a commentary in which the editors (Robert Funk and Roy Hoover) explain the reasoning behind each decision (determined by the votes of members of the Seminar). The commentary more or less follows through on the assumptions delineated in the introduction, whose shakey and uncritical nature we have seen. The format is a little difficult to follow, for the comments are added in between chunks of text, rather than added in footnotes, which makes it a little difficult to read the whole text.The format, however, is the least of the Jesus Seminar's problems. I have no objection to historical criticism, and wish any true scholar luck in his quest to find the ""historical Jesus"". It is not the unconservative conclusions which I find so reprehensible here: It is the flawed methodology and the blindness of the Seminar to its (ironically) uncritical and unreliable assumptions and presuppositions. If this is serious scholarship, I am afraid it seems we are in an academic climate where anything goes.",book

1997,"QUESTION: How does a film merit two different titles like ""The Librarians"" and ""Strike Force""? <br /><br />ANSWER: The film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldn't even decide on a title!!!! <br /><br />This film is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death wish-vendettas, melodrama, romance, and other clich√© film techniques. The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious, multi-lingual, pockmarked creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south Florida. <br /><br />Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film, and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls I have ever heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in ""The Godfather."" <br /><br />Also appearing in this film is Erika Eleniak, who has infiltrated the inner circle of Marcos' bizarre world. Erika's character kick-boxes her way into an alliance with Simon. The Librarians and Erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable TV converter box.",movie
1998,"First let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes. It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people. For me, like most folks here, Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.<br /><br />The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of Jesse and Celine's discussions, but rather the little nuances, the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other. It captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt that they won't each other again.<br /><br />The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.<br /><br />See it and it may change your way of life.",movie

2005,"I don't usually read fiction, why, maybe it is because much of it plays fast and loose with the facts, yes I know, that is why it is fiction. Anyway, I was looking through a book catalog when I saw the title OUR LADY OF THE LOST AND FOUND: A NOVEL. The descrtiption intrigued me, so I purchased a copy. This is my first introduction to Diane Schoemperlen. I liked the style of this book, part diary, part history, and part written meditation on God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Love, Grace, and Faith. While I thought that the author did go off on tangents once or twice, most notably her chapter on FGM, on the whole this is an almost perfect book, for me. I liked the story and could identify with the characters. The main character being, my presumption, a reflection of the author. Schoemperlen asks the questions of the ages, that have always been asked. Those times at night, when we wake up and stare at the ceiling. For a non-Catholic Diane Schoemperlen really has a grasp of what the Virgin Mary means to Catholics and their fellow Christians. The book is a great little history of Marian visions and Marian devotion. I consider myself on the conservative side of Catholicism and enjoyed this book immensely. I can highly recommend it to Catholics and non-Catholics alike who wish to understand the part Mary plays in the life of many Christians. This is actually 4 1/2 stars. A definite buy.",book

2012,"In the beginning of this film, one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him: he is black and male. But in addition to that, he has a third strike: he's gay. ""You're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined,"" he is told. ""Paris is Burning"" is a documentary about gay black and Hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals.<br /><br />The miracle of ""Paris is Burning"" is that director Jennie Livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity. We learn their views of homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable it's tragic. Many of the people are seriously in denial;<br /><br />This is not a film for everyone. There are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this movie isn't for you. But if you do see this movie you'll realise ""Paris is Burning"" isn't really about men wearing women's clothes, it's about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large, and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives.<br /><br />I've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991, because it says so many things: it's a commentary about materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about rich and poor people, about the media and what it celebrates, about fame and adulation. ""Paris is Burning"" is one of the most humane, and one of the saddest, movies I've ever seen.",movie

The way Vonnegut makes his character travel through time is so unique and the idea that Billy is unstuck in time is hilarious. And when he gets abducted by aliens it just gets better. The aliens see everything in 4 dimensions so they can see the past, future and present at the same 'time'. They know exactly when the universe ends and begins and they know also that there is no way to change anything because it already happened, it happens and will always happen. This idea is very philosophical and really interesting. This book is very stimulating and truly makes you think.

2026,"I have waited a long time, wanting to write a review to do this book justice. I am relatively new to the fantasy scene, having read maybe 7 or 8 fantasy books before this one fell from the heavens into my hands. But I have been an all-around reader for as long as I can remember, and this is definately one of the top three books I have ever read, if not the best.Where do I start? The characters are incredibly amazing, well-developed (if a bit cliche, but all Swords &amp; Sorcery is, lets not get into that); you find yourself marveling at their nobility and human shortcomings at the same time. Yes, they are too close to perfection to be realistic. But umm, look at the genre title carefully for a moment. &quot;Fantasy.&quot; Hmm. Somewhat antonymic of Reality, don't you think? Anything goes in a fantasy book, and I'd never want it any other way. Richard Cypher is a resourceful, strong-willed, young protagonist. As many characters in the story repeat: &quot;You are a rare person, Richard Cypher.&quot; Kahlan Amnell, holding a secret inside which could shatter the first friendship she has ever had, is strong, passionate and noble, of birth and spirit. Zedd is just Zedd. He's the comical relief and sly wit of the novel.The storyline is full of action and a beautiful, tense romance between souls (you'll understand what I mean almost as soon as you start reading). Plots weave into and out of each other in magical patterns. Speaking of magic, Goodkind (the dude's a genius in my opinion) develops it in awesome models and explanations, supporting the imagination with the &quot;how's&quot; of magic as well as the usual &quot;why&quot; this wizard or that wizard conjured magic.There's also a twisting theme of psychological, moral, and philosophical issues, not force-fed but smoothed into the core fantasy, leaving you wondering: &quot;what would I have done?&quot; in restrospect. Rather than mire the pure fantasy plot, this engages the mind in a mature, reflective fashion.If you haven't already decided to buy this, I have one more comment. I chose to read this book over my favorite shows on TV. I chose this book over the internet. Over music. Over schoolwork. It was like a tempting chocolate cake sitting on my bedside table, I couldn't leave it alone, I kept coming back. The 700 something pages FLEW by. Read it. Really.",book
2027,"&quot;The Water Method Man&quot; could easily be renamed &quot;John Irving's Frankenstein&quot;. Bits of first-person and third-person narration, a movie script, and an Old Low Norse epic are patched together to form a book at times funny and other times almost unreadable. The end product is entertaining and probably too clever for its own good.The story focuses on Fred &quot;Bogus&quot; Trumper, the shallow, immature man who fails at one marriage, almost fails at another relationship, becomes the subject of a mockumentary, and undergoes painful surgery to correct a rather sensitive defect (hence the title of the book). Throughout the tangled web of narratives, Bogus eventually grows up a little and is perhaps on the way to becoming a good husband and father.For fans of Irving, this earlier work contains all the elements of any of his novels--Vienna, prostitutes, New England (everything except a bear). Having read the author's memoirs I know that at least some of the material is based loosely on Irving's own experiences. There are more humorous elements in this book than later ones like &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; or &quot;Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;; I would say &quot;Water Method&quot; is the funniest of the Irving novels I've read to date.The writing, the characters, the story are all vintage Irving--there's no point in discussing those. The problem is HOW the story is told. The setting changes so much that as a reader it's hard to get into the flow of the book until it's almost over. There were many times when I thought about just giving up and putting it back on the shelf, but I pressed ahead and--like Ian McEwan's &quot;Atonement&quot;--my patience was rewarded with a story that when pieced together is humorous and a little touching (for an Irving novel). Other readers, I suspect, would have less patience waiting for everything to come together.Should you read this book? Yes and No. If you're an Irving fan, then definitely Yes. If you've never read the author before or didn't like what you read by him, then No. I still recommend &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;, &quot;World According to Garp&quot;, and &quot;Son of the Circus&quot; as my favorites, but &quot;Water Method&quot; is up there in the pantheon of Irving novels.",book
2028,"To give you a little insight on my opinion, I was assigned to do an ""outside reading"" for my U.S. History class and I picked this out of the list of acceptable books. This book really does pack a lot of information into it for you, and it breaks up the monotony of facts and locations by throwing in little stories, examples, and quotes, which give history a little more ""personal"" feeling. The first chapter is a real snoozer, dealing mostly in population figures and growth, but it picks up from there. I also found the last few chapters on religion and the Great Awakening a little redundant, but still interesting.",book
2029,"William Golding's book of classic woe and hardship, the book tells of a group of young boys who are stranded on a deserted island. With no adults there with them they have to find the strength inside of them to survive on their own. The book starts off great with the boys getting along and learning how to work together, until they start to get power hungry. Ralph is voted to be chief of the group but you see the inner battle of how to rule, the side of hunting and playing and enjoying the stay at the island with out parents, or watching and tending the fire to get rescued. While Ralph is dealing with this another one of the boys wants to be chief and decides that hunting and playing is the way to go, he wants Ralph out of leadership and that is where the struggle begins. The fighting between the two boys brings out the evil in all the boys on the island. The book is the tale of the evil that mankind carries around, unknowingly, with them. It tells of the evil in all of us. Can society live and survive being good? Or does this inner evil take over? This book does a marvelous job telling of that.",book

2031,"Doesn't this seem somewhat familiar? Oh wait, that's right.. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been done in the TV series. What's the point in repeating yourself, you may ask? Is it for the benefit of the Americans who haven't seen the programme? Did the scriptwriters run out of inspiration? Or maybe everyone on set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia, and forgot they'd covered this ground already? Either way, for someone who has sat through the first three series, this was just really boring. I had to turn it off during the 'tablets that turn your water green' part.. yes it is very funny, but give us something original for goodness sake! Actually, if the best new stuff you can come up with is Leonard Rossiter's take on Saturday Night Fever, you can forget it.<br /><br />The guy they got to replace the late Richard Beckinsale is a lookalike alright, but not half the actor. Personally I would exorcised the role, as a mark of respect to him. Or better yet, not bothered making the film at all, and just let the hilarity of the TV series speak for itself.

2032,"Finally, a delicious and reasonably priced BBQ place in town. By place I really mean takeout kitchen. This place is not sit down.

Parking is available on Tyne as well as Kingsway. If one is quick, one can also park in the alley for a few moments.

The kitchen is not on Kingsway, but in a secret room downstairs in the back. The front is some Chinese travel agency. There is no access from Kingsway. I didn't peek in but I assume it's a big empty room with a BBQ grill and oven.

Guy is friendly and chatty. I think it's a one man show. This guy also has a food truck. He mentioned he's often by either Grandview and Renfrew (by the McDonald's), or by Main and Terminal. Guessing those are for the lunchtime crowd, as this kitchen is open during dinner hours. He mentioned the truck location is on the BC Street Food app. Best to look there if going for lunch, as the location changes day to day.

For dinner takeout from the kitchen there is a 15% discount as of the time of writing. Bonus.

I tried the beef brisket, BBQ pork back ribs, and mac and cheese.

Beef brisket - definitely on the greasy side. I didn't mind personally, but just a heads up. Not as salty as the competition, which is honestly a good thing (most other places use way too much salt). Nice and moist. Served with container of sauce.

BBQ pork back ribs - nice and tender. Precut into blocks 2 ribs at a time, which makes it nice and easy to eat. Special mention. Lightly coated in sauce.

Mac and cheese - swirly pasta instead of conventional macaroni. Once again, taste is just right. Most other places are way too salty. Was a bit clumpy, though I suspect this is because it had cooled down somewhat on the way home.

One thing I really like is that this place doesn't just drench all the meat in sauces by default. Instead, the sauces are in a few small containers on the side, such that I can mix in however much I want. Besides being able to taste the actual BBQ flavours, I can now also save some for my next home meal. Bonus.

Really liking this place. Will be back for more meat fixes. Recommended.",restaurant

She has an inner strength, tenacity, and drive to try new things that I greatly admire.Not only that, I really like this particular biography of hers. You can definitely see her personality as she talks about her early life, her spirituality, her friends and family, and her career. This is real ""don't care what people think"" Dolly Parton. Whether you agree with her or not, you've got to admire her honesty and focus. There are some humorous stories about her family, her childhood, her friends, and her career and she does a great job of painting the picture of her life growing up. The tone of the book is an interesting mix of humor and spirituality that is hard to find in other biographies.I always like to see celebrities who really know who they are and have no issues telling it to the world. I think she is a great role model and example of following your dreams and working at it when it seems like there is no hope.",book

2046,"The Adventures Huck Finn is a story about a young rebellious child in Langley, Missouri. This kid was counted out from the beginning. He was born the son of the town drunk so he was a trouble maker from the get go. Huck one day finds his care takers slave Jim hiding out in the woods planning his escape, so him and Huck and Jim travel down river to help Jim escape his captivity. While traveling they had many and hardships, dealing with con-men, rednecks, heavy fogs, big ships, and dressing up like a girl, typical day down in Missouri.This book is in a more classic American literature novel genre. One thing I can say is that it is accurate to that time. The characters true to their own culture. The N word is used through out so I'm pretty sure the dialog was also accurate. There were a lot of things that happen yet I was still pretty bored reading it. It was slow and when it did pick up not much happen.So even though this book is an American classic I would have to say I didn't like it much. I would give this book a 3 out of five rating and I would recommend it to people who like American history and adventure books, but besides that I wouldn't read it again.Tim W",book
2047,"BACK COVER: Charlotte stared at the man through a mist of confusion. It was Logan. An older Logan, of course, but unmistakably the man who had ravaged her emotions and then abandoned her all those years ago.She ought to feel angry. She ought to feel resentful and cheated. Instead, she was apprehensive--terrified at the complications he could create.""We are not through, Charlotte,"" he told her flatly. ""I sometimes think we haven't even begun.""REVIEW: The original copyright for this book is 1977, although I think I have had my copy since about 1983. This is a sad story, and one that I thought for a while could not be resolved. The bottom line is that an older man, Matthew Derby, had been in love with Charlotte's mother during the war, but she had loved and chosen an air corpsman for her husband. Both of Charlotte's parents were killed when she was young, and Matthew took her under his wing, keeping her from being raised in an orphanage.Matthew works for a local university, and, as Charlotte grows into maturity, she becomes a teacher for a local pre-school. Enter Logan Kennedy. Logan is from Brazil, but is studying for a time at the university, and Matthew becomes interested in his work. One night, he invites the young Logan home for dinner, where he meets Charlotte, and inevitably, they fall in love. Charlotte is torn between love for Logan and duty to the older Matthew, who is possessive and ultimately, is making Charlotte pay for her mother's jilting him. Charlotte becomes pregnant with Logan's child, but it is years before she learns the great extent to which Matthew has gone to ensure that the lovers never meet again.Finally Matthew dies, and then the story truly begins. Unknown to Charlotte, Logan has kept a distant eye on her for years, and under the guise of offering the new widow a job with a home for herself and her son, he invites them to San Christobal, the island that is the home base for his marine biology.This is a tense story of lies, twists and impossibly situations, not all of which I liked, and it took most of the book to unravel them. I gave it five stars, however, because I felt the characters were truly in love, and despite impossible odds, they finally came to love each other and their son in the end...and after all, aren't happy endings what romance novels are all about? You must have patience, but in the end, this is a great story! Enjoy!",book

I guess we just got lucky on our first visit, we were seated within minutes of walking in. The decor is exactly what you would want in diner. It has a 60s/70s feel to it. 

The service was amazing! Our waitress was so sweet and tentative. She made sure our food and drinks came right on time. She refilled our coffee cups so often that I had to make a comment on how great she was! Food was great, no complaints. Quality, presentation and taste was a 10/10.

2051,"Upon reading Atlas Shrugged, I expected the book to be a mind opening experience, being that I am a recent college graduate learning to deal with the corporate world, in which I expected this book to have it's themes. I have never been more disappointed in my life. Here are the reasons:As an economics major, I can speak first hand to the invalidity of Ms. Rand's philosophy. Her philosophy is narrow-minded, and really has no factual basis. She has little understanding of capitalism, it seems that all she really does is highlight the extreme negative qualities of communism (she spent part of her life under that system in Soviet Russia). She fails to recognize the many different social programs and government interventions that are absolutely necessary for a sound economy, instead she offers a utopian view of laisse faire capitalism in which everything works like clockwork when the government just butts out. A history lesson for all of you that agree with her...look up the late 1800s and read about what happens when there is laisse faire capitalism. Exploitation, poverty, etc. Another example is the dust bowl of the 1930's before subsidized farming.Another reason I did not like this book is that the plot dragged and I felt it was poorly written. Ms. Rand really beat a dead horse through many of the chapters to prove her points, which of course I didn't agree with at all. The book also gave a view that people are an &quot;island&quot;, meaning what we do does not affect other people, so in her view everyone should be completely selfish and do things only for themselves. This is also entirely untrue...everything that people do has a ripple effect through those around us, whether we see it or not. Once again, Rand offers a very adolescent philosophy on life.Another thing that surprised me was Rand's chaevenistic view of women and condescention of the common man. I expected Dagny Taggart to be a strong, self-sufficient character, which she is in the beginning. But what Rand is really saying through her need of and submission to Francisco, Reardon, and ultimately Gault, is that even the strongest woman ultimately gives herself up to a man. This is part of Rands whole &quot;hero worship&quot; theme, which I think is rather warped. She also treats the common man as a useless, mindless creature that the world can do without, as the world crumbles when Galt recruits the great minds to his utopia, and of course the utopia flourishes with just the &quot;producers.&quot; In her world, only the greatest minds, essentially the leaders are needed (hero worship again.) Once again, she fails to see the big picture. Where would the world be without people to tend farms, work in factories, pump gas, and flip burgers? She fails to see that everyone is part of one big machine, again she thinks that people are all individual islands that either produce or loot those that do. I thought that this was also ridiculous, as I disagree with just about everything Ayn Rand stands for.This book was nothing more than a pretentious, drawn out manifesto in the disguise of a mystery story if you ask me. Her ideas are warped and her philosophies are narrow and innacurate. All in all, I don't see how people consider Ayn Rand and influential thinker. She offers the viewpoints of a troubled teenager, not a great thinker.",book
2052,"If any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills, this is probably the one. I've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way, but having a strong feeling. The movie was disturbing at moments. However, the movie was terrible at editing. The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place. Like Karisma is getting beat up, and the same time SRK is fighting (comically) with the police officers. The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place. On top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning. The direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about.<br /><br />I have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely. Without them, this movie would not have an impact. Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza. She looks pretty in the first half, and I've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her. What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date. Nana Patekar was excellent as her father-in-law. Not much to say about him, besides this is a role made for him. Deepti Naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene. Though she doesn't have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good. The other good performance was the little kid. He was adorable, and is sure to bring tears to the viewer's eyes. The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances. Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he didn't have much to do. Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role. <br /><br />One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina. The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song. And boy Aish is mad hot. However, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever. People may have come to the movie for Aish, but they won't brag too much about it after-wards. Hum Tum Miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie. Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about. Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie. Despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see.",movie
2053,"Pun intended. This low budget action/horror vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick things is the stuff direct-to-video fare is made of.<br /><br />The plot: Wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public. Police chase him, vampires chase him, he responds by kicking...a lot.<br /><br />There is a little more to the story, but it is so inconsequential that I honestly can't remember it; I think people actually spoke in the movie, but that's up to debate. The plot is nothing more than a set-up for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time, usually by kicking them.<br /><br />The technical specs are, in a word, anemic. Little color treating, amateurish use of lighting, simplistic use of camera and angle. Blood and gore is noticeably limited, odd for this type of film. The most hurtful of the filming foul-ups is the jarring shift to super-shaky cam during each and every fight scene. If the camera begins to bounce around like a reese monkey on speed, then you know Don is about to start kicking everything in sight.<br /><br />All in all, this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise, do not watch, unless you really like to watch things get kicked.<br /><br />3/10",movie
2054,"Animation always seems to be fringe. In Japan, this might not be the case, but in Europe and much more so in the USA animation has a big fat ""KIDS"" tag on it. France is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries, home of classics as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on(if you've never read these, it's not too late. There's no upper-age limit on them and they don't carry the nerd-stigma of DC or Marvel) It seems natural a movie like this one pops up in France. It suits my prejudiced image of the French as art-loving, anti-USA-oriented and talented movie-makers. Luckily there's also ""A scanner darkly"" out there to suppress that view - seems art is pretty much international.<br /><br />Anyway, as you might have gathered Renaissance is artsy and French. If you're a normal person you will get scared by this. There's no need for that however! Beneath it's cool, sleek cel-shaded appearance there's a good thriller and a good movie overall.<br /><br />That was one of my fears for this movie. It's so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick, much like Sony & C:o are doing with their Pixar rip-offs. I was expecting a confusing, sometimes boring and not very engaging movie, but luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well. NOTE: I've seen the French dub which was OK as far as I could see. English might be more interesting what with Craig and everything.<br /><br />A final word of praise to the animation. It was awesome. Futuristic, well-crafted, nice camera-work, smart solutions(Eyes for example looked very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning I felt like bursting out ""This is so damn impressive!"". Then again, I really like animation and I appreciate the effort the studio put down, so my verdict is a bit biased.<br /><br />Good movie anyway, definitely lives beyond it's ""gimmick"".",movie

2057,"I couldn't make sense of this film much of the time, and neither could anyone else, based on other reviews. The opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story. In it, a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend. He is assigned to photograph a mountain range. It's rumored to be haunted, but I couldn't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film. On his way, he meets a beautiful writer (Patty Shepard) and convinces her to join him on his working trip. Throughout the film, there is this terrible music score, mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream ""SHUT UP ALREADY!!!"" What really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it's about to become good, though it never does. There is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere. The inn and the silent, abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous. The foggy nights look real, not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set. And the idea, while not original, had potential. But it never does improve, at least not enough to be worthwhile. Here's how it goes, more or less. They stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper (you expect him to be named Igor) with a hearing problem. There is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window, but the scene is so dark, I had no idea what was going on. Whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me. In any event, we never find out know what happened. There is a scene where she wanders off during the night. Whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained. Another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen, then found again, with nothing stolen. They wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman. There are other things, including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained, an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way (will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them?), the witches themselves, a bunch of brunette women in white robes who don't show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained. Even the closing scene doesn't make any sense. When all is said and done, most people will be saying, ""Huh?""",movie

This is the first movie I rated 1 star at IMDb.com... Second, none of the characters are likable. You really don't care what happened to them... Third, the villain is very easy to identify.

After I experienced it for the first time I realized that here was a writer that was saying all the things I've always felt but in a funnier and truer way than I could ever imagine.The first time I read it I was struck by the humor of the characters and situations. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is so adept at making the most tragic situations laughable I didn't notice the sadness of the characters.But the second time I did see the loneliness, yes, the solitude. I think that's why Gabo is so good. Unlike most writers he doesn't just show the realistic side of life, or the depressing side, or even the funny side. He shows it all. And since he brings magic, death, humor, love, and everything else to his work he creates not just a &quot;good book&quot; but a whole world that sometimes seems more real than our own.",book

I miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. I don't think that the story itself is enough. Martha/Kate is more secluded, and Mario/Nick is not a clown. In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here.

2074,"Having some idle time before going to work, I looked at my ""50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics"" DVD collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack: Zis Boom Bah starring a forgotten Grace Hayes. ""Classics"" is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles I've never heard of and I suspect they're all in the public domain. Anyway, this movie also stars her son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (who I just found out is a New Orleans native from the state I live in, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as a malt shop proprietor and Huntz Hall, taking a break from the East Side Kids, as Peter's buddy. The plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is, is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though I did like Peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with Hall in drag. And the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. Rubin, however, is all over the place with his confusion of the American vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever (though I did like his funny dance).

At age of 34, after the love toward his 22 years old care-giver didn't go well, he decided to come to the US to face the doctor who said that he would have only 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive, and weights 39 pounds. Why?

Why is tracking down this old doctor in the US is a journey of his lifetime?

2079,"Sensitive film does lack brilliance and, to some degree, narrative structure, but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed. However, the narrative structure point is debatable. While it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes, and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a ""story"", I'm sceptical as to whether this feel *needs* a ""narrative structure"" that is definite and detectable. Inevitably, it will be compared with SOMERSAULT in that its central protagonist (I'm not sure that's the correct word!) is a young, and very young-looking, woman, whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her - although of course Cate Shortland's film tackles this aspect better. But while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a clich√©, PEACHES is, in some ways, much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. Perhaps that's where it doesn't quite make it. It's certainly very different to Monahan's first feature - THE INTERVIEW! I'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung added to the story. Who knows - maybe they did. They certainly rammed home the compromised and flawed nature of Weaving's character - although I personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenes.<br /><br />*****JUST SAW THE FILM AGAIN*********<br /><br />On a second viewing, I can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature. But I'm not sure how distinct these 'categories' are anymore, or even if we should be making that distinction. In any case, I do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark efforts. On the other hand, the film's structure is very formal, and its content is hardly challenging,at least in the way SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, THE ILLUSTRATED FAMILY DOCTOR, LOOK BOTH WAYS and THE HUMAN TOUCH are. The performances are all good, but I did come to the realisation that the main reason I was enjoying the film was because it fit the ""Australian"" genre, without necessarily adding anything...and I can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person *NOT* to like it! Indeed, it wasn't until Lung enters the room in her Vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch. But that leads us into another debate - *should* we expect that a film must challenge us all the time? Certainly I enjoy being challenged by a film (or a book, or other people), but is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story?<br /><br />I haven't deleted my initial post on this film, because I'm all too aware of the Orwellian overtones of such an act. But I would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6.5.<br /><br />As for nominations for AFI Best Film, my votes go to THE HUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WAYS - and I think LOOK BOTH WAYS should win.",movie

2081,"Absolutely dreadful Mexican film supposedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc... When our hero, Gaston, is given the grand show by Dr. Maillard, head of the asylum, we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific, such as men hanging around long in a dungeon, and comedic, such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building. Then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both: a human man dressed as a chicken, yes, that's right a chicken, that pecks around the ground for chicken feed. The scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film, but, at least for me, it was the film's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining. Ah! That is indeed the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, of which this is one, have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely garbage. It has very little going for it. The only performer worth having a look at is Claudio Brook as the head of the asylum. He is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally, bellows orders, sashays with sword in hand, and praises the chicken. I got so tired of hearing him talk about the ""soothing system"" as his means to cure the mentally sick. What a bunch of ludicrosity(Hey, a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word). It won't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting. Cinematic chicken scratch!",movie
2082,"Very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. The performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. However, despite the film's many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. The location shooting in New York City, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior ""The Naked City"", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. Otherwise, it's not much to write home about. It is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets.<br /><br />.",movie
2083,"1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these films weren't particularly good, they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona. However, by this film, the familiar ""Little Tramp"" character was still in development. Sure Charlie looked the part, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit, kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all.<br /><br />As for this very slight film, it is interesting to watch for the cast. While they are not familiar today, Chaplin stars along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain--all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and improperly developed. Chester and Mabel got to the race track (a very common theme in Keystone productions--it must have been located near a race track). Charlie and Mack show up and sneak in. Mack is chased by the police for doing this while Charlie slaps Chester around and steals his girl. In the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack away--leaving Charlie with Mabel (who, oddly, didn't seem put off by Charlie's boorish behaviors).<br /><br />Unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian, this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of Chaplin. What he and the other actors actually do on stage, while not unusual for a Keystone film, isn't particularly funny when seen today.",movie

2085,"I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of ¬£8000 but that didn't really show. There wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting, the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and uncharted planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each-other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive. There weren't any great explanations of what was going on, which can be really contrived, so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like The Big Empty which was a film I also enjoyed. I found that I quite warmed to most of the characters, there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments, the men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathise with them and the film's climax and ending were quite poignant. I think Mr Stirton and his crew should be quite proud of themselves I've seen worse films with a budget of millions.",movie

I think this place is probably more about hanging out on the patio and having drinks. Definitely not a place you want to drop $100 on food and feel incredibly dissatisfied. 

Tuna Poke: Visually not very appealing. It is essentially tuna poke with pickles on top. It was super watery too.

Steak Frites: I wish we took a picture of this. It was the tiniest piece of steak and was not cooked evenly. 

Thai Avocado Salad: This was the best thing we ordered. It was good. It had plenty of avocado.

Chicken Wings: Thrown in the box with blue cheese on it...why wouldn't they think to put the sauce on the side. Also when it states celery and carrot slaw we were thinking more so a salad. It just looked like chunks of them thrown on top.

0/10 for presentation of food (even though it was for pickup it could have been packaged with more care).

The strength and beauty of this film is in the direct, earthy performances of the cast.I have seldom seen Jean Harlow display such a range of feeling, rich and subtle nuances float over her face. If you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters. The raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant: when Clark Gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son, lifts him up and proudly says, ""My kid!"", I couldn't help remember that Mr. Gable's own son was born to him posthumously. This is one of the finest examples of Depression era cinema.",movie

The basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend.Instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall.Beware:some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists.",movie

I watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash. This movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end. Acting is great, story is absolutely original, flash-back technique very affective.

Writer Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs some new material.<br /><br />The only twist is the deranged boyfriend/police officer pursued by internal affairs, but even that opportunity is wasted. Lots of setting shots of the Seattle Space Needle necessary to disguise the obvious Canadian shooting locale. Some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled through town on a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or put the brakes on once in a while. Selma Blair is inert and the short haircut a crime. $3M to Jason Lee, for what?

The naan wasn't the overly puffed kind, it was dense and perfectly grilled.

The samosas weren't too salty (a common pitfall), and the vegetarian filling was very tasty.

Aloo Mutter, Aloo Gobi, all the Aloos we ordered were yummy!! I think Indian food is special because of the collision of spices, and overwhelming the veggies with spices can be just as unsatisfying as underwhelming them. This was balanced to me.

If you know anything about Norse mythology, you know exactly where Chabon is coming from. It's funny at times the way he matches up old charactors with new faces that represent the previously serious with stupidity and things of that nature.This is a book you read when you're young, then re-read again to catch it all. I can see where some people are coming from when they claim the book takes too long to start, but I dont share these opinions. The book was put together that way for a reason. It lays the foundation for the understanding of the more complex concepts of the book. I personally wish he'd explained more thoroughly. This book was written for children with the best intentions, but i think Chabon lost his original purpose in writing this. I loved this book, but I believe it is mislabeled.",book
2097,"....so why on Earth would I see 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men'? Answer: Johnny vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas I have seen live and thoroughly enjoyed. I think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to retain extreme oafishness. Crook I know only from probably the greatest comedy of the last 10 years along with 'Alan Partridge', 'The Office'. As Gareth he was simply hilarious, and I was interested in how he would convert to another character on the big screen.<br /><br />OK. So me and the boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night and the film was very funny, only because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter Ferris and Dave had was delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of Vegas and Crook. They are destined for better things (have done better already infact) and I even believe Vegas would make a decent straight actor. The trite scenes where he says he misses his wife came almost close to touching, although the **SPOILER** tacked on scene at the end where he is taken back by his wife needed to be lengthened, it just wasnt believable. And throughout the film Vegas only appears to miss his wife 2 or 3 times.<br /><br />The film became grotesquely unfunny and plain old, well, grotesque, when sex was mentioned. Not, I add, when it was shown on screen. Tolly's gratuitous explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why was not even slightly funny, and just made me feel a little bit ill. Also totally unneccisary was the inclusion of the character of Jeremy picking his nose, before showing a close up of the bogey on his finger. Just him picking his nose would have raised a smile, he was a pathetic character and it would have just made him look as low as possible, but showing the snot close up was just not needed and was rank.<br /><br />One scene I did think was hilarious involving sex was Vegas in the threesome. His blokish conversation with the second bloke just highlighted the fact that threesomes arent always endless ecstasy. Not that I'd know.....<br /><br />That's about all I can say really. I will end with this, and this is actually my main critique of the film. This is supposed to revive the British film industry. It is no 'Trainspotting' that is for sure....it isn't even a 'Love Actually' (you'd have to have a heart of stone not to throw up at that one), and 3 million pounds really could have been put into a better project. 'Mike Basset England Manager' was a wonderful little known British comedy and was made for far less than 3 million. I only hope that the BFC will learn from 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' and not get so gratuitous in future. Although the terrible reviews this film is getting are only enhancing the box office takings. :-)",movie

The story revolves around a married Episcopalian clergy couple and the inner workings of their Parish and by extension their New England town. The pace is very slow and it's tone steady and sure and the book definitely knows where it is going so even when you begin to get sort of bored, stick it out. The major themes are: religion, love, family and friendship and it is a well rounded book. My only quip against this book is that as with any non-Catholic Christian novel, there is the customary jibe at Catholicism. I still recommend it.",book

Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />Stripperella has even better production values than similar Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it seems that they've taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible.<br /><br />The humor is good too, on the sexy, suggestive and sleazy side. It is very similar if not exactly like the Simpsons style. You may encounter clich√©s and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless.

2106,"I was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of 'Scoop' last night. Full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause. I didn't speak to anyone who disliked 'Scoop' although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film. They were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves.<br /><br />'Scoop' is a quickly paced murder mystery. A young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose. Plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman.<br /><br />'Scoop' isn't a bad addition to the Woody Allen filmography. It isn't his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp. I'd say it fits quite comfortably into being an average Woody Allen film, right in the middle of the pack. If you're a Woody Allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself. If you're indifferent to his work then 'Scoop' might be enough to get you interested in seeing more. I don't think that anyone who dislikes his style of film-making and acting are going to change their mind. Woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we've grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film. While potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he'd hurry up and just spit out the words, Woody Allen fans know what to expect.<br /><br />Very good performances all around in my opinion although I found myself missing Ian McShane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough. Hugh Jackman is great as the charming nobleman and I think Woody Allen has found a new regular star to work with in Scarlett Johansson. I think that with 'Match Point' this is their second pairing and she's just magic with the material that Woody gives her. Could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! I'm glad I saw the movie and definitely recommend it. More sophisticated comedy than movies like 'Scary Movie 4' so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former, 'Scoop' probably isn't for you. If, on the other hand, you like a touch of class, sophistication and fun, 'Scoop' is for you. Probably not the Woody Allen film I'd introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try.",movie

(I am a Physics major and I do NOT like Biology.)At the time, I found it readable, although it seemed full of information. Without a professor lecturing, I probably could not have picked out the &quot;wheat&quot; from the &quot;chaff&quot; in this book. That's where my comment in the title comes from. This is a heavy book!Now I teach high school science. I am in a really small, rural school, so I teach everything, grades 7-12. Obviously, that includes Biology, Advanced Biology, and Anatomy. As I already said, I don't like Biology. Furthermore, the textbooks I have available at my school are so error-filled and ideologically driven that I've chosen not to use them and write my own material instead.To do this, as someone who doesn't like Biology, I need an accurate, reliable source of information. This book is excellent for that. I've taught Biology long enough now to be able to pick out what I need in high school and toss the rest. This book is accurate, reliable, and clear. Furthermore, the pictures are excellent.However, in any book or writing, it is important to be brief and to the point. I would never choose this book for even an advanced course. It is too full of information. I suppose Campbell is trying to appeal to a broad market: chemistry focus, genetics focus, ecological focus, or some other focus. However, this creates a big book. Maybe this is appropriate at the college level, and this is certainly a college book, not high school, but after my experience both as a student and as a teacher, I think Campbell needs to find a focus.In short, brief summary: it is not appropriate as a textbook, particularly in high school, but it is an excellent reference book for teachers at all levels.",book

2112,"I was aware of Rohmer's admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts, and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures (as Renoir's or Chaplin's very last movies ; yes, the ""politique des auteurs"" also has its dark side). But with ""Les amours d'Astr√©e et de C√©ladon"", it's as if Rohmer himself wanted, for what may be his last movie, to perpetuate this tradition of great directors, who made a last senile movie, by adapting Urf√©'s ""L'astr√©e"", with ridiculous aesthetic codes, witch just look like a parody of Rosselini's last movies (the ones he made for TV from Descartes or Marx's lives).<br /><br />In his version of ""Perceval"", Rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re-transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things. The director apparently changed his mind when the XVII century is involved, and films actors, dressed like 1600's peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes. But the all thing looks even more ridiculous than Luchini and its fake trees. It's not that the story itself is stupid, but the way Rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny (and I'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors, the annoying and sad humorist tries by Rodolphe Pauly, the ridiculous soft-erotic tone, the poor musical tentatives, or the strange fascination for trasvestisment!).<br /><br />The radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke, which mixes a soft-erotic movie made for TV with theological scholastic discussions (sic !). At the beginning of the movie, Rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity, and that's why he had to film ""L'Astr√©e"" in other parts of the country. However, I'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting, if Rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions. This film may interest a few historians, but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad Rohmer's movie.",movie

And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.<br /><br />While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders!<br /><br />David Newman -- yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping.<br /><br />The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's ¬ëManfred' being a particular treat.<br /><br />The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as a DoDo comes from.'<br /><br />This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.<br /><br />It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home.",movie

You see, I've known for a long time that the principles discussed in this book were true. I lived on a Chinese diet for 2 years and I know I was healthier while I did it. I've known for a very long time that a diet of wholesome vegetables, fruits, and grains, with meat eaten sparingly, was best for me. This book adds the weight of irrefutable scientific study to what I already knew but didn't have the discipline to live.And I really don't trust science very much. Well, actually, I have no problem with the scientific method. I don't trust scientists whose findings support the special interests that fund them. And that covers 99% of the scientific findings that are presented before the general public. The second half of this book is devoted to demonstrating how special interests skew ""science"".I believe Dr. Campbell because he stated what he found even when it was counter to the interests of those who funded him. I have done a cursory scan of the literature available on the Internet for refutations of Dr. Campbell's work and found only posturing, heated rhetoric, name-calling, and references to the kind of studies that are clearly biased in the interests of the funders. In other words, I found only the sort of thing that has destroyed my faith in scientists.Now I'm obligated to make that life altering decision.

2126,"During the Civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated Confederate ladies' school; where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about, until trouble starts brewing between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it all comes at a price in the end. <br /><br />""Dirty Harry (1971)"" (which was made about the same time of ""The Beguiled"") might be my favourite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after seeing this, I tend to think this to be the pairs' finest work together. A very atypical, savvy and stylish vehicle for Eastwood is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by Don Siegel and a hauntingly rousing music score by Lalo Schifrin. Standing out strongly is its sultrily lurid and bleak nature that's intrusively planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity. It's assiduously played out and makes it more the brooding and blood curdling when those random shocks and saucy intentions take hold with gripping tension. The way Siegel illustrates John B Sherry and Grimes Grice's alluring bold, slow-burn screenplay (taken from the novel of Thomas Cullinan) is effectively done through stark emotions and the script's tight, lyrical context. Siegel's strong direction captures the idyllically southern Victorian setting with such potently garnished photography and he sets up some strangely piercing imagery with great clarity and restrained. <br /><br />While the performances, are truly commendable and high of quality. Clint Eastwood as the smoothly suave, sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured. A profoundly eminent Geraldine Page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a delicate sincereness to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and Jo Ann Harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona. <br /><br />Honestly while Eastwood's charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs, there's still mixed intentions there that the one's being played (where rivalry between the women creep in) turn out to be no better than their guest at the end. Throughout there's a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material. What's demonstrated here, is simply more than your basic little minded shocker, but one that's thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that's hard to shake. That also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song. <br /><br />A effectively chilling, low-key item that's hard not to be tempted by it's swinging hospitality.",movie

2128,"Why didn't critics like this movie?? I don't get it. This is easily my favorite Clive Barker effort. ""Hellraiser"" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film just never leaves that stupid house) and, lets face it, ""Lord of Illusions"" doesn't move at all!!! I have loved Barker's writing for years, especially his ""Books of Blood"". Terrifically entertaining. He has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a Stephen King. He freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements. I love love love love it. I also realize , however, that Barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. And fantasy just isn't my bag. Puts me right to sleep. Always has. I also think Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to wander a bit. That was my experience when trying to read ""The Damnation Game"". It started out well. Then 100 pages in I thought ""where is this going?"" because it wasn't going ANYWHERE.<br /><br />I read ""Cabal"" (the book Nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. I ESPECIALLY like the elaboration on Decker's character. The way the mask talked to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker simply presents it. Black and white. There it is. He gives it a simplicity that's attractive and believable. When asked why Decker kills he says (simply) ""Because I like it"". Probably something Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point.<br /><br />But I actually liked the film Nightbreed better than Cabal. I adore the visual attention to detail that Barker gives to his films. ADORE IT. I think it is just beautiful. Lord of Illusions had some of this as well. Some of the drawings in the beginning, during the Nightbreed credit sequence. It's like an entire vocabulary Barker dreamed up just for the Nightbreed world. I'd be curious to know how much was purely his design. I know he is an AMAZING artist who his own style and language as an artist.<br /><br />Nightbreed is also (I think) BArker's most entertaining film. It moves very quickly. Well edited. It doesn't drag like Lord of Illusions does a little bit. Very quick. Everything in it is just perfect. It also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. The stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff. That mask is frightening. I'd be curious to know if Barker designed that as well. It's not just a hokey Jason or ""Scream""-type mask. Something about it is really disturbing.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great flick. Definitely check it out if you haven't seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror films of all time. In my opinion Clive BArker's best. It IS scary and violent though, be warned",movie

2131,"Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable. . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother, aided, abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget. The very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger whom I do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade. Also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads. I thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all. The movie I kept surfing back and forth to, had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much. Unless you like an unbelievable story, wooden acting, a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one. Oh and maybe a small carping criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery",movie

2136,"This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.<br /><br />Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did the part justice and certainly looked the part. But nowadays, it strikes me that the Nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around.<br /><br />His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over his ""Penguin"" days from Batman. Although he doesn't do his Penguin ""quack"" here, he is without parallel as the maniacal Professor. Only John Colicos, of Battlestar Galactica fame, chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot.<br /><br />I never can recall what the grudge was between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been severe, since the Prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper Nemo, and vice-versa.<br /><br />The effects were nothing special, though Prof. Cunningham's submarine was way better looking than Nemo's. It also had a crew of strange, fish-like amphibians that served Cunningham and did his every bidding.<br /><br />However, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunningham's secret weapon. The Delta Beam! He was forever saying ""Fire Delta Beam!"", whereupon, a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug. Truly priceless! They don't make them like this anymore, and perhaps just as well.

2140,"STORY Chinese Tall Story tells the story of righteous monk Tripitaka, who, along with his guardians Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy make their journey west on a quest to recover ancient Sutras, finally, they reach the final leg of their journey in Shache City But all is not as it seems when the city is attacked by evil tree demons. Monkey tries his best to battle them but is overwhelmed, knowing his master is in grave danger, he uses his trusty golden staff to thrust Tripitaka to safety.<br /><br />The monk ends up being knocked out when he land and when he wakes up he finds himself in the presence of a young lizard imp named Maiyan who takes quite a shine to our young hero, after many verbal misunderstandings Maiyan becomes convinced Tripitaka loves her, so when the monk decides he must rescue Monkey and the others, she insists on accompanying him. So the mismatched pair begins their adventure together.<br /><br />REVIEW Okay, so, it's another Journey To The West movie, which isn't a bad thing to me since I love the story and the characters associated with it, so I was a little excited to get my hands on the DVD. So I think I'll start off my review with the story, which is all over the place, at first it was your standard fantasy film, then it became a ridiculous comedy then suddenly became full blown sci-fi, if the director Jeff Lau was experimenting with mixing genres then he did a pretty scatological job with this movie. I think it's a pretty unique approach by having the story centre on a character other then the infamous Monkey King, especially taking a character as pacifistic as Tripitaka and then putting him into what is at it's core a love story. So overall, I liked it.<br /><br />The acting is for the most part solid, with leads Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi putting in some really good performances, though Ah Char does spend most of her screen time behind some rather ugly make up. The supporting cast is nicely put together, it includes all the usual EEG main stays so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong make appearances, one actor I'd like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays the Monkey King, he did a good job with the limited material he seemed to have been given, he played a version of the Monkey King who was subdued yet arrogant, I had a feeling he'd be retreading Twins Effect II territory but fortunately that's not the case here. I hope he gets to do a follow up to this with himself in the central role, since the film does leave itself open for a sequel.<br /><br />Okay, so let's get down to the directing, which again is kinda all over the place, Lau gives too much time to the Stephen Chow-esquire nonsense comedy, which includes a scene where Tripitaka in order to toughen himself up, dresses up as Spider-Man, which I assume lead to many a head scratching moment since the film is meant to be set in Ancient China. He does create some really nice and tender moments between the two leads and does delve into sappy territory but this reviewer does enjoy a bit of sap on occasion so it didn't bother me in the slightest.<br /><br />Right, now onto the CGI, which for the most part is quite bearable, there are a lot of moments which probably belong on a PS2 like many other reviews have stated but there are some cool moments particularly the scene in which Monkey battles a flying minion. A lot of the CG gags are provided in the form of the golden staff which turns into a range of different things, ranging from a giant fly swatter to a mech suit straight out of The Matrix Revolutions. So yeah, it sounds crazy but I guess you'd have to see it to believe it.<br /><br />Right, so in closing A Chinese Tall Story isn't a movie without it's flaws but it keeps itself together long enough to be able to entertain and generally be a overall enjoyable movie. If all of the above doesn't swing you to see it how about I put it this way, it's much better then Twins Effect II.",movie

2147,"This documentary on schlockmeister William Castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive '50s-'60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work--look at the funny, silly people with the ghost-glasses--but it's also affectionate and lively, with particularly bright commentary from John Waters, who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time, and from Castle's daughter, who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft. (We never find out what became of the other Castle offspring.) The movies were not very good, it makes clear, but his marketing of them was brilliant, and he appears to have been a sweet, hardworking family man. Fun people keep popping up, like ""Straight Jacket""'s Diane Baker, who looks great, and Anne Helm, whom she replaced at the instigation of star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with Castle on ""The Tingler,"" and there's enough footage to give us an idea of the level of Castle's talent--not very high, but very energetic.

The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.<br /><br />I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that, the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.<br /><br />Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story. Eventually, I grew as bored with his remarks as I did the rest of this movie.<br /><br />I am a big fan of South Park, and other animation aimed at adults. I also play several online pimp games, so I am partial to stories about pimps.

2158,"It was hard to read this book at first because of Kate Chopin's style of writing. But once I got used to it after a few pages, I really got into the book. The reader really comes to feel Edna's pain and want for freedom. I must give Chopin tons of props for having enough courage to write a strong female character and daring to use sensuality and lust in her book, even though it was written in the late 1800s (a time that even mentioning a passionate kiss on the lips in literature was forbidden). I got so into the book that I felt as if I were Edna living in a opressed world. Read this book to learn or get more knowledge on how women were treated during the Victorian Era...it is a must read!",book
2159,"""Her Cardboard Lover"" is Norma Shearer's last movie. She quit the movies and, I think, joined the Board of Directors at MGM. That was a good move on her part. ""Her Cardboard Lover"" was talky and boring in parts. It was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat. <br /><br />The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer) hiring a man (Robert Taylor) to make her playboy fiancee (George Sanders)jealous. I am surprised that the director, George Cukor, did not cut many of the talky scenes between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in ""The Women"" but not in this movie. <br /><br />The best performance in the movie was given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylor's career, he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and ""When Ladies Meet"" in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy performance in ""Her Cardboard Lover"" and, up to then, his best dramatic performance in ""Johnny Eager."" He had a busy year. I think of all the actors at MGM, Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot. Also, MGM gave Mr. Taylor all types of movies to make - most of them were successful. That is why MGM kept him for 25 years. <br /><br />Mr. George Sanders was very good as a socialite heel. He played a similar role eight years later in ""All About Eve"" for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. As for Ms. Shearer, this was one of her worst performances, she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939, ""The Women"", and gave her best performance. It was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in ""Her Cardboard Lover."" Also, it didn't help that some of her clothes were awful.<br /><br />Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the superb ""Escape"". The same comments about this movie can be said of another movie, ""Personal Property"" that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too talky, boring, and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor, so in 1937, she died at age 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.",movie
2160,"Went here for dinner after walking the beltline. Liked the variety of the foods on the menu and enjoyed most of the tapas (small plates) they offered. I personally ordered the Miso Ramen, which disappointed me. It came with a poached egg on top but it was undercooked (as in, there were raw egg whites which made it inedible). The soup itself wasn't anything remarkable. The Roti was fantastic though. Service was good. Don't know if i would come back unless invited.",restaurant

The main problem is the service of the waiters, both the person who helps you at the salad bar and the waitresses who serve you at the table. We were told that because of the covid, they now bring the meat to the table without asking for it. Ten minutes passed and the first of the meats had not yet arrived. We had to call their attention several times to bring food. The worst thing is that the waitresses who wait on the tables spent time talking among themselves whispering about the customers instead of worrying about what was really important. Clearly it is not worth spending so much money for the entire menu since they take advantage of the fact that they only bring three or four types of meat instead of the eighteen that they advertise.",restaurant
2162,"What a thrill to be allowed to comment prettily on this book. In fact what a thrill it is to live in a time when so many domestic conveniences at our disposal give us the extra time that is needed to read great literature like this - of course, after we've completed our chores and accommodated our sweetheart's every whim and appetite. I, for one, am so pleased to be allowed occasional and appropriately limited access to a modern computer after my Husband and his children have gone to bed - it's 4 AM as I write this! - so that I can share my thoughts about this book. [Would it be appropriate for me to suggest that American women take a moment every day to thank Men for permitting us - no, even encouraging us - to learn to read in the first place? Again, how fortunate we are to live in a modern society where (even though we haven't the capacity to make intellectual contribution, and thus must realize that reading and writing by women is frivolous recreational activity with no actual value to society) women are allowed books, and writing instruments!] Ah, but I've strayed from the topic. (Silly little me! how this would amuse my Man, who lies sated in a nearby room!) My purpose here is twofold: One, I wish to recommend this book with 2 girlish thumbs up and suggest that every girl in America read Fascinating Womanhood and respond appropriately to its Teachings. Two, and only because matters of female physical attractiveness and appearance of youth and childishness - manufactured, if necessary - are of such fundamental importance, I humbly request information from a reader, publisher, or perhaps, the author, herself. Can someone correct my imperfect reasoning --- what woman can perform even the simplest math, after all! -- and explain why dates of birth and college entry in an author's bio suggest that Mrs. Andelin is soon to be 80 years old, when her publicity photos (book cover, The Fascinating Girl, and Author's home page, Andelin-2000.com) depict a woman of 18 or 19? You are truly a goddess, Ms. Andelin! Thank you so much, everyone, for listening to my insignificant and superficial female thoughts on a subject of such great importance - how we might better prepare ourselves to achieve our highest calling - that of ornament, domestic, and sex slave to the good - or bad! - men who would take us as their wives.",book

2165,"Dr. Barton has done a magnificent job of introducing the Roman world to the modern reader. Throughout the book, she makes reference to the differences between modern culture and that of the Romans without simplification. This was not an easy task, since the book will probably not be a disappointment either to a well-read Classics scholar or a beginner in both its clarity and thoroughness. Dr. Barton did a great job in weaving together the various texts of the Roman world into a complete picture that is captivating. Yet, I never felt lost, even as a beginner in this area. For me, 'Roman Honor' was a real eye-opener, not only to the Roman world but to my own. I think Dr. Barton offers marvelous insights into the roots of modern society while exploring an ancient culture. One of the best books I've read in a long time.",book
2166,"As of the time I am writing this review 368 out of 398 reviewers gave this book a 4 or 5 star rating - that's 92% ""I liked it"" and ""I loved it"" ratings. With these many positive reviews there are some critical reviews as well that are worth reading to get a balanced overall review - there may actually be more (and likely are more) than 5 love languages or categories. The author has a significant amount of knowledge and experience regarding married couples and it is certainly worth considering his input. What will make the information in this book the most beneficial is incorporating it with personal experience, and this subject will likely be a ""work in progress"" project with a focus on getting better everyday to result in a lasting, happy, and fulfilling marital arrangement.My favorite review is ""Learning to Speak, December 23, 2010"" where the reviewer's review could have been a superb foreword for this book. May I suggest reading it as in my opinion it is brief, clear, and simple. If you have time consider reading the other reviews and comments too.Of course, some may not agree or totally agree with this book's author; however, the subject of marriage is simple, yet complexed - and even compounding at times.In my opinion this is one of the better books on this subject. There is some good material here making it worth considering reading it.This book did stimulate my thinking on the different viewpoints in marriage and if you'd like to read my comments on this marriage subject contine, if not please feel free to move on. I am just hoping that some of these thoughts may help some considering marriage or who are already married.Some believe that men and women basically use different parts of their brains. Often heard are: ""The left brain thinks, the right brain feels."" ""The left brain analyzes, the right brain intuits."" ""The left brain is logical, the right brain is emotional."" Likely, our thinking, feeling, and loving are more complex than these simple statements; yet, at least on occasion (likely more often) men and women think and feel differently and express themselves differently - the author of this book identifies, categorizes, and classifies love into five languages. I would add one additional language, which is the ability to sincerely and promptly say ""I'm sorry"" from one's heart. From my 45+ years of marriage and from what I have learned from many others, a successful, lasting, and happy marriage involves two great forgivers and apologizers. In my three and a half decades of managing people I have found that those who never or almost never say ""I'm sorry"" have difficulties with their working and personal relationships.A husband and a wife differ to varying degrees about how they both think and feel about things, and this is in harmony with how the Creator said regarding Adam that He was going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him (not an identical twin of him - she was made different in a good way). A complement completes, perhaps making something just right. A husband and wife will benefit from loving each other, especially as the other person wants and needs to be loved.Couple this with deep respect and you hold the two keys to a successful, lasting, and happy marriage and family life - Love and Respect.Hopefully adding this thought will help your loving and respectful marriage grow more each and every day: ""I love you more today than yesterday, but only half as much as tomorrow.""And one additional thought: ""It is more beneficial for me to be respectful and loving in all that I do, than for me to be loved (something I very much want).""Every marriage has the potential to be successful, lasting, and happy, especially using the two keys of ""Love"" and ""Respect."" Your marriage can be a most precious, valuable, and wonderful gift by using these two keys with sincerity and heartfelt caring; and, never let pride, the childish silent treatment, or other unloving disrespectful traits mar your treasured marriage!A good ""PRIDE"" antidote expressed before the end of the day: ""I'm sorry - I was mistaken - How can I make it up to you? - I'll do my best to be better - Will you please forgive me?""A good ""CHILDISH SILENT TREATMENT"" antidote as soon as possible: Rescue the loving, caring, and respect adult within you. ""Whining"" and ""I won't talk to you"" are childish - they rarely worked in childhood and have no place among true adults. ""Scolding"" and ""Lecturing"" is easily blocked out. The best communications are loving, caring, and respectful adult expressions coupled with a big dose of attentive listening and understanding.In ballroom dancing it has been said that ""it takes two to tango,"" and ""it takes one to lead."" Many have found a successful, permanent, and happy marriage includes three - the loving husband, the respectful wife, and the Creator and Author of marriage (who perfectly knows what's best).A good question to ask yourself at the beginning of each day: ""What will I do today that shows I both love and respect my spouse?"" TIP: While certainly one positive act or action daily is a good start, many are even better and will bring more benefits.ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL READING: ""One Minute for Myself [Yourself]: How to Manage Your Most Valuable Asset"" by Spencer Johnson, MD - while it is good to have a great relationship with your spouse; it is essential to have a good relationship with yourself, especially if your goal is to love your neighbor as yourself. Keep in mind if this is one of your goals that your closest neighbor is your spouse. Good relationships with ourselves and others I believe is what our true success in life is all about. My thought is that one needs a good relationship with oneself first in order to have good relationships with others - and it is wise to pursue ""self-respect"" by being respectful of yourself and all others. I like the thought of ""self-respect"" rather than ""self-esteem"" because it is easily possible to think too much of oneself; better to just focus on being respectful, caring, loving, and having proper self-respect.ADDENDUM: One of best ways to tell your spouse ""I Love You"" is to say ""I love you just the way you are."" The principle here is if you want to be accepted in any relationship you should give your acceptance first. How many of us really want someone to relentlessly badger us to change this or change that about ourselves. Change in itself can be difficult, but that is another subject to consider.",book

2173,"I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called ""Laupta: The Flying Island""). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the ""Streamline Dub"" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the ""streamline"" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films.<br /><br />This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

2180,"Best to label this story a fantasy despite the fact that such fantasy is revealed in only a few paragraphs. Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale. But no such ending was provided.",book

I would like to point out that Morey Bernstein never once in his life said that this story was proof of reincarnation. Not even close. He said that it definitely warrants further invesigation into the phenomenon. At the time the book came out, the western world was against any idea of reincarnation as it flew in the face of western thinking (Although, lets take a look: hundreds of millions of people take reincarnation as a fact of life as part of their religion). The discreditors of the story never once found any way to show the story was a fraud. In fact, the discreditor happened to be a Chicago TABLOID!!! The women allegedly named Bridey Murphy who lived across the street upon further investigation turned out to be the mother of the TABLOID's owner. The person below me mentioned occum's razor (the simplest solution tend to be correct) Think about that. In fact, when a more credible Chicago paper picked up the TABLOID's story, it had to cut out a whole bunch of arguments because they were just way too outrageous. ex: When Ruth Simmons was a girl she had a park accross the street which she played in many times. This explains why she would have said she lived in ""the meadow.""Now that is just ridiculous, especially when a hand-drawn 1800's map of the city Cork, the area in which Bridey lived according to Ruth's sessions was called ""The meadow."" Now Ruth, living in America her whole life, and having never even heard of the town called Cork, recalls an area of only a couple square miles in the 1800's in Ireland. None of this was made up. Everything Ruth said under hypnosis has been verified to be real and not a hoax. am i saying that reincarnation exists? After reading the book, i believe.

Like its unofficial remake, Murder at the Windmill (1949), the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading a cast of super-decorative girls including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to ""Cocktails for Two"". Undoubtedly the movie's most popular song, it is heard no less than four times. However, it's Gertrude Michael who steals the show, not only with her rendition of ""Sweet Marijauna"" but her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend. As for the rest of the cast, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen altogether. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak running gag with cult icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over-indulged and over-strained, super-dumb Inspector McLaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though, would you believe, in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect. Director Mitch Leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close-up after close-up.",movie

Reminiscent of the destruction via perfidious gossip in THE CHILDREN'S HOUR or the Puritanical vigilantes in THE CRUCIBLE.

Having thought the world of such a poor (and short) copy I find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than I thought possible.<br /><br />This was the lovely Meena Kumari's film from start to finish, and I believe was planned by her from 1958 on, finally realising it in 1971.

In some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face.<br /><br />The story of Purity versus Adversity I can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it, but I'm led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in India. It's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message, an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too. But to me it's the peerless golden music by Ghulam Mohammed as sung by the incomparable Lata Mangeshkar - especially Thare Rahiyo - and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding. I've seldom heard such serious, beautiful, poetic, wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack. Singin' In The Rain may be my favourite musical film but Pakeezah has my favourite music - yet Lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her. The only pity is that the also unique Mohammed Rafi only had the one song in here, albeit a classic duet with Lata. <br /><br />Because of all this but not blind to its faults, Pakeezah is my favourite Indian movie, filmed at a time when the Westernisation of India was gathering pace and watched now when Western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur. At the very least watch Pakeezah for a taste of what Indian ""pop"" music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines, the Bollywood Beat and bhangra.",movie
2195,"Above-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time. A scent of ""Pleasantville"" camp hangs around this flick. As a period piece, it's more accurate than not. Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving. Chris Cooper turns in a first-class performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy.",movie
2196,"The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD (I only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because Kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. I saw them when they were originally shown on TV here in the UK but had forgotten most of it. Am I satisfied with the ending? I think I am. Naturally as I fan I would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination. In many ways ""Endgame"" is similar to Next Gen's ""All Good Things¬Ö"" The involvement of the crew in the future, but mainly the captain. A new romance starting in the finale (Troi and Worf in Next Gen and Seven of Nine and Chakotay here), which results in death in the future. I truly loved ""Endgame,"" fair to all characters, Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. B'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband Tom. Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. Harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. The Doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name Joe! But of course the Captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. The Borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of Voyager. Alice Krige plays the Borg Queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent. I feel sorry for Susanna Thompson though, the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen. Maybe she wasn't available though. The special effects are fantastic, the Borg sub space hub and the Borg queen falling apart! It's very tense. Especially when they come out of the Borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. And what a wonderful idea to get inside a Borg sphere for protection, on the DVD special features they say it was like the Trojan horse. Voyager could have continued. If it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in Harry's speech and what Tom said because his wife and child are there. And then they could have got home in a film!<br /><br />Overall, Voyager was a bit hit and miss. The sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. The two episodes set in the Holographic Irish village are horrible! My perception of Seven of Nine was that she took over, it all revolved around her, which wasn't true. When she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. And her character is ingenious at times, 20 years as a Borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. I like her, especially in ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" ""Imperfection,"" and ""Human Error."" When Naomi Wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely. Chakotay became my least favourite character. Gone was the chemistry with Janeway (will they/won't they?) and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time. I loved seeing Tom and B'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds. I always liked Neelix a lot. Tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with Neelix. Harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. The Doctor is probably my favourite, seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates (""Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy"" is fantastic!). Janeway is my favourite Captain of any series and you can tell Kate Mulgrew is really enjoying it. <br /><br />I wish there was more, I love Voyager!",movie

2201,"As a grownup in my mid-40s, I am not even close to any of ""Nancy Drew""'s key demographics, but I was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon; so, I could tell, were the pair of sixtyish silver-haired ladies down the row from me. The older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20-ish female usher (who said she'd seen the film the previous evening and quite liked it).<br /><br />More to the point, however: In the row just ahead of me, there were nine -- count them, nine -- ten-year-old girls lined up next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previews.<br /><br />Once the film began, they promptly settled down to watch....<br /><br />....and didn't so much as peep till the closing credits began to roll.<br /><br />This is not a perfect film; it doesn't quite pay off its high school subplots, it's not quite confident enough of its own tone, and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward critically inept at times. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot hangs together fairly well, and it treads deftly between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts carries the movie with startling grace -- Josh Flitter's superb timing notwithstanding, this is Roberts' movie, and she pulls it off beautifully. Her Nancy Drew is very much the direct ancestor of Kristen Bell's Veronica Mars, and the film is also a lineal descendant of Jodie Foster's early and underrated ""Candleshoe"".<br /><br />In today's marketplace, it's a rarity: a family movie that respects its viewers' intelligence. As such, it won't be to everyone's taste -- but for what it is, it is the best movie of its kind in decades.",movie
2202,"There is a reason why the Scalet Letter has the station of a classic in todays society, and it is because the book encompases a grand depth that is severly lacking in so many books in our contempoary society. It is not a book for an imature audience, as its themes run multi-layered and can be misunderstood by the ignorant mind.

2207,"When they killed off John Amos's character they killed the show. He was the vital part of the info structure. You had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how. They were poor, they were black, and they were living proof that if you have Jesus and your family that nothing is too hard. Sure James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way. <br /><br />James was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children. Florida was the strong lady that would everyone including James when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it. The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit. Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family. Things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. James dies and JJ took over the show. <br /><br />Flo was still mom, Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show. We were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment. I guess James's paycheck didn't do much for the family. They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working. I know that JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real. James worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren't realistic at all and that's a shame.<br /><br />JJ was the comic relief but I felt the show need substance. It's OK to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs. Michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evan's show. I mean really, here was a guy that was failing in school, he kept getting laid off, and he painted for money in about two episodes. James had always been there to encourage his talent but Flo and the rest of the family didn't seem to care.<br /><br />Why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do? He could have sold painting's on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards. (He did but something went wrong with that.) Why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams? I'll tell you why, it was because they didn't have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams. The show stopped teaching us about growing, building and learning and started teaching us about gimmicks and catch phrases. They should have kept James. If any show needed a father it was that one.",movie

The huge commercial success of that Mae West vehicle convinced the studio brass that Gay '90s melodramas were a viable proposition. Here we are rewarded with a fast moving, well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars.<br /><br />Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a little harder to take, but it is Fay Wray who steals the film with her stock-in-trade damsel in distress. With a strong director - as Walsh proves himself to be - Wray could carry a lot of punch, and she is utterly believable as the object of both Raft and Beery's affection.<br /><br />Lots of atmosphere, beautifully designed, this is a forgotten film worthy of revival.",movie

2215,"No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real ""encounter"" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead ""Sadhu Agashe"" has killed"" - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory. Movies which are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan meanders close to very good. But yet remains one of the Top 70 films released from India, commercial and artsy included.<br /><br />What is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally (in an Indian flick) how the police network works. The cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell (though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny) The producers are trying for a Cannes release, which is interesting. Made by debut director Shamit Aman (i think thats his name).<br /><br />Again 55 y.o. Nana Patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past, just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief.<br /><br />Again Patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie- relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialoges, good acting, nice direction all in all Great stuff. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma's Company (both Indian flicks)",movie

Sadly, I am not suprised that no teacher mentioned it even once during my years in college. Why at the age of 33 did I just now discover Ayn Rand?About the characters being black and white: the point is not that the heroes exist in real life but that they COULD and sometimes do exist. And that we can model our lives on the principles which they espouse.The book contains several wonderful passages that I love to read again and again: the description of Starnsville, the chain of command that leads to the train disaster, d'Anconia's speech about money, Hank Reardon's trial speech, and the tramp's description of what happens when the Starnes children take over the motor factory, where he used to work, the last of which is an apt microcosm of Communism and many other passages as well.I find this book to be joyful, an affirmation that it is okay to be happy. Most important to me personally is that we do not have to subscribe to what we consider evil in the name of misguided concern for our fellow man. Suffering in of itself is NOT a virtue.

2236,"I'm always hearing such fabulous things about Jennifer Crusie. People rave about her books and eagerly anticipate new releases. And I just don't get it. This is the second book of hers I've read and I haven't liked either one. I was bored to tears with this one by page twenty. It got a little better as the story progressed, but I still couldn't wait to finish and be done with it.The whole vibe of this book was just bizarre. The only thing I can really say that I liked about the book was the humor. Crusie does do well incorporating humor into her books, but it doesn't overcome the short points. I had problems with the story right from the start. The introduction of all the various (many) characters is poorly done. They are all just sort of plopped in there like I should already know them, and I ended up confused as hell until they were better established later.Romance wise...so-so. There was chemistry between Nick and Quinn, but I wasn't feeling the sentimentality of it. It was just sort of like too people getting together for the heck of it and because of a long standing friendship. I had some problems with the fact that these two people were good friends for like fifteen years or however long it was...hung out, were close and all that...but only now a sudden sexual overtone pops up. That just kinda didn't work for me. And the characters overall where just very one-dimensional, with very little depthWhat really killed the romance of this book, and just the story overall, was the faithlessness of everybody. It seemed like there was cheating going on left and right and nobody gave a damn. Well, they do, but not to the extent they should, and it just seemed exceedingly bizarre. I mean, one couple is having some marital problems, so the husband decides he's gonna go on a date with the town [...]. Then Nick's not sure what he wants to do about Quinn, so he dates the town [...] Another woman decides, what the heck, I'll take my husband back now that he's been dumped by the town [...]. Then Quinn's parents have some bizarre problems and her dad goes out with the town [...]. Quinn's Mom reveals she's had a long-standing sexual relationship with another woman, kicks her husband out, has her girlfriend move in, and Quinn's Dad is just like, okay whatever guess I'll go find myself a date. It was like nobody in the whole book had any respect for commitment and monogamy. I just didn't find anything pleasant or romantic about that and it drove me nuts.In the end, I just found the book as a whole rather stupid and campy. It was like reading a cheesy soap opera with fickle, whiny woman, clueless men, and rotating romances. There was absolutely no substance to the story whatsoever. Why people act like Crusie is the next coming, I just don't know. I certainly don't plan to read any more of her books. If you like lame, very superficial beach reads, then, hey, go pick this one up. But if you like stories that have more substance, I wouldn't waste your time on this one.",book

2240,"Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan. Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes. <br /><br />A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game. It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact. City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease. A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles. <br /><br />Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community. Regardless of outcome, you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist. <br /><br />Richard Widmark as Dr.Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers. Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of (restful more than comic) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald. Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie (Black Death?) is simply outstanding. With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well. In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially in the film's powerful final allegorical moments. <br /><br />Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan's best non-Brando film. It's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited. It's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb.",movie
2241,"I first saw this film two years ago in the cinema, and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step-mother. Their relationship with their step-mother is strained to say the least, with the step-mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. The film though slants with Oriental style ghost effects and horror, which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear, but is all the more intriguing.<br /><br />The direction is incredibly good, and the acting is stunning, with the step-mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. The large house adds eeriness, and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. You simply don't get anything like this in the Western World, sadly,and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade.<br /><br />Highly recommended viewing in my opinion, a real joy and scare...",movie

2244,"Prior to watching ""Dahmer,"" I thought no movie could be worse than ""Freddy Got Fingered."" I was wrong. To sum ""Dahmer"" up, it's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed. There is no plot to be found, and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about ""Dahmer."" All you'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men.

2246,"The Curse of Monkey Island has always been my favorite of the series. A vibrant visual look, an excellent soundtrack and brilliant voice-cast all create a memorable and humouristic adventure.<br /><br />Graphics wise the game is definitely not a let-down. Though some corners have been cut the over-all feel of the game is reminiscent of Disney Feature Length Animations. The gameplay is simple and even a novice will get the hang of it soon enough. The game also offers a little extra for the more experienced players with its Mega Monkey Mode.<br /><br />The voice-cast is one of my favorites. Dominic Armato's sympathetic voice makes Guybrush complete and Alexandra Boyd is simply charming as Elaine. Earl Boen makes for a wonderfully sinister yet over-the-top villain, LeChuck. Also the game's charm is added by memorable characters like Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my personal favorites Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, voice of Scrooge McDuck). My hat also goes off to the late, great Kay Kuter and his memorable secondary-role as Griswold Goodsoup.<br /><br />Michael Land's tropical and wonderful soundtrack once more graces the Monkey Island adventure, comprising of some of the best tunes in the business.

The delicate contour of ideas are crushed. The subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is basic instrument for create a good image of American realities.

All the utensils and drinks are self serve. The host (who I'm assuming is the owner) was very nice as he would offer his assistance whenever we had a question. The layout of the restaurant is simple with 5-6 booths lining the walls. A quiet and mellow atmosphere with a lot of customers in and out (a lot of take out orders). Once ordered the food came in less than 10 minutes. 

Rolls ordered: 
-  3 maki lunch combo (tuna/mango+Salmon/avo+ red snapper/avo)+ Crab ragoon 
- Double spicy tuna maki 
- Scorpion Maki 

Pros:
- Very hefty pieces of maki (they stuff a lot of fish in the rolls) 
- The salmon and tuna were very fresh 
- The mango was very fresh 
- Crab ragoon was crispy and creamy
- Special rolls come with 10 pieces and regular rolls come in 8 pieces. 

Cons:
- Not a fan of the red snapper (was on they chewier and fishier side) 
-  The double spicy tuna maki was a bit too much spicy tuna (expected as it IS double) but when eaten the flavors did not mix well together. 

Verdict:
- Nice little place to satisfy your sushi craving. The price is a little on the higher side (just by a couple of dollars per roll/combo) but the fish did seem very fresh. I would definitely come again!",restaurant
2253,"Rand wrote The Fountainhead to illustrate several points: revealing how morality is based on egoism, showing the importance of architecture, showing how progress comes from the individual and not the group, how evil people subvert the arts, and how her protagonist Roark is the perfect human being.I enjoyed the book, but not for the reasons she would have wanted. It is a relentless and humorless novel of overt propaganda. Rand is at her best, not with her grand themes, but her smaller nifty insights. I found Roarke to be a flat character who designed buildings about as attractive as Albert Speer. He was a genius in some ways, but also an emotional cripple. Rand keeps telling the reader how wonderful he is, but shows him largely humorless, as a rapist, unable to talk to friends about feelings, someone who is silent and then gives long speeches, and someone who is conflicted. This last point deserves the greatest attention. In all of her writings on this book, Rand states how Roarke is a wonderful character, the best in all of us, who is not conflicted at all. However, what she shows in the book is much different from what she tells. Rand is at her best dealing with supporting characters, never her main ones. With her supporting cast, what she shows and what she tells about them is consistent, but for her main characters, the showing and telling is divergent. I ended up enjoying this book as an example of taking an argument to its extreme, and as the grim story of a conflicted if talented emotional cripple.Some people really hate Rand, others really love her work. The truth, I suspect, lies in between. Her novels may be masterpieces, but they neither deserve the acclaim or derision they always receive, but instead, deserve some judicious perusal and open-minded discussion.",book

He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard I thought I'd pee. They don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh God...you will die. Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant. He's not in a lot of the movie, but when he's there, you know whose movie it is.

2255,"Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather, is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines Minnie as a 'sister' is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with James Belushi as her husband. Classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again. Thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times.",movie
2256,"Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies, because it translates personal, subjective opinions on war, opposed war action movies where action, and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. <br /><br />The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject, and manages to distance itself from usual war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in, spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. Perfect irony.<br /><br />The acting is truly exceptional, and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts, hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted.",movie

Although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic, experiments are being conducted now to do just this. I will note that this experiments are in a very early stage, with results so far not favorable.<br /><br />The characters in the movie are well cast. The girl, although overacting a bit, looks suitable dumb. The truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers. The minister conveys doubt at first, (The principal investigator tells the minister that him (the minister), is not sure whether he believes that God created man or that man created God. But the minute when the chips are down, he falls back on his faith. Only the PhD plays the zombie. The secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters.

It's like that lame Baz Luhrman film ""Romeo and Juliet"" where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale. Well, Baz Luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess. The story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro-American cast is racist in itself. It's also puerile and simple minded (like Baz Luhrman-man he's a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He's also IN the film! How can it be racist? It's not.

Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.<br /><br />I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused. Anicee had a healthy career, who's life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late 2006. She was a beautiful and talented actress.<br /><br />VHS tapes of FRIENDS can be found at Amazon.com occasionally, but usually for a significant price; I've seen it as low as $60 or so and as high as $152 (as of this comment, there were two for that price).

2265,"Most of us know ""Shane"" from the excellent movie that remains a high-water mark of realistic depiction of the Old West. Better than the novel could, the movie conveys the dust and grime, the slower pace of events, the backbreaking work of a kind no one in America knows anymore -- and the ways confrontations were handled before the arrival of law and order.Commonly a book excels its movie, and this one is no exception. The story proceeds as a brewing range war between a Wyoming rancher and small farmers toward the end of the 19th Century. Ironically, in the never-ending struggle between ""the old ways"" and modernization, the small farmer here represents modernization - and small farmers themselves no longer exist.The principal characters embody themes as old as literature. Before farmers ever got there, the rancher Fletcher cleared the range of marauding Indians by whatever means worked. In a might-makes-right situation, it probably needed such men to lead the westward migration. Fletcher certainly considers himself wronged as farmers begin taking over the land for which he put his life on the line. That the law favors them doesn't matter; Fletcher respects force and little else.Joe Starrett emblemizes the civilizing virtues: energy, intelligence, sense of community and honor, moral and physical courage, self-discipline, belief in family and self. In a later Schaefer novel Starrett reappears as Chet Rollins. His very physique - large, awkward, physically powerful - stands as a bulwark to which his fellow farmers repair for advice and leadership. Especially in lawless circumstances, such men represent the institutions of civilization to the less sturdy.Shane is many things, all of them complex. The book cover caricatures him as a gunfighter who can't escape his past. Shane is more than that; he's a white knight, his life echoing the Greeks who said that character is destiny. A man of substance who disdains the company of most, Shane honors substance in the Starretts. They take to each other immediately.But Shane has another side that he keeps on a leash: the inner leopard, the big cat that lives and hunts alone, striking fear in those around him. ""Bad ones like him are poison,"" Starrett observes. Shane unhesitatingly takes on hugely uneven odds against Morgan and his gang in the saloon, and it isn't just, or even particularly, courage or heroism. He instinctively relishes combat, violent action, dominance, perhaps even cruelty. The leopard blood passion -- and control of it - occupy Shane's core. He cannot be imagined without both.Shane brings to mind another hero who entered American consciousness 13 years before this book appeared: Rhett Butler. Rhett has more rebellion in him, but shares with Shane an unerring sense of himself and the milieu in which he moves. Both manifest extraordinary physical ability and competence. As Rhett truly respects only Melanie Wilkes, so Shane only truly respects Joe and Marian Starrett. Neither man feels threatened at knowing ""women's stuff"" such as ladies' hat styles. Both understand the crucial importance of role models to kids. We know more of Rhett than of Shane, but we do know that Shane somehow let himself down in the past, as Rhett before joining the fight against the North.At a deep level, this story concerns free will and its consequences. It deals with the choices men make and how the con-sequences of these condition further choosing. Men are tested constantly, and must constantly choose the moral tenor of their response. A man who yields to cowardice, in the many ways that can be done, does irremediable violence to his soul. Once done, it can't be undone and he can't be who he was. Good men have always known this; it's why honor matters, projecting their sense of themselves as moral agents. What others think also matters, but secondarily to their self-opinion.This theme bears directly on another, that of heroes: what a hero looks like in real life and how he affects others. Schaefer doesn't want us to miss this, so he provides a stark contrast with Shane in the person of Stark Wilson, a man with whom Shane has a great deal in common. Wilson, too, is a leopard. But while Shane puts his leopard passion in the service of principle, Wilson indulges his passion. With jungle mentality, he lives for the kill. These men made different choices along the way, and those choices conditioned all that followed. One can imagine Shane degenerating morally into a Wilson, but cannot imagine Wilson, all moral decay and depravity, evolving into a Shane.Hence Schaefer, perhaps without realizing it, posits morality as evolutionarily selected. Yet neither Shane nor Wilson marry, and indeed one can't imagine either of them domesticated. They are curiously sexless. But Shane will have progeny in the persons of those who idolize and model on him. Wilson's blatant evil drives others away. He lives solely for himself, so much so that he has nothing to give anyone. His role in the world is to serve as a bad example.Six years before this book appeared, Ayn Rand brought out one of the great novels on the theme of heroes. The Fountainhead explicates the philosophical issues, but lacks the balance and realism of Shane. In Rand's pantheon, Shane would fit right in while Joe Starrett would barely merit mention. Her heroes never have children, the reason FOR civilization. Yet in everyday living we seldom encounter a Shane while running into Joe Starretts often. Starrett is the enduring hero who has much more to lose (hence to win) than Shane does. Shane is Michael Jordan, magnificent in action, stirring and memorable, the apotheosis of excellence, showing what's possible. But that level of excellence is physically beyond most of us. It's for admiring rather than emulating.The day-to-day heroes matter more. Joe Starrett needs Shane, but everyone else needs Joe Starrett. Shane knows this. His role is to step in as needed and then, work done, to move on. As he does in this interesting and most excellent short novel.",book

Divided, as it is, into the categories of &quot;Who, When, Where &amp; What,&quot; the reader can easily find the principal photographers from 1839 til today (&quot;Who&quot;), the moment of greatest significance for a particular style or method of photography (&quot;When&quot;), the cities, countries and continents in which a movement was centered (&quot;Where&quot;) and the nature and origins of the style or technique (What&quot;).For example, we learn that &quot;collage&quot; which had long been used in decorative arts, was actually first used in fine art when Picasso pasted oilcloth onto his 1912 painting &quot;Still Life With Chair Caning.&quot; We learn a useful, simple definition of collage and how some modernist painters/photographers have used it including David Hockney and Robert Frank in the 1980's. We learn that in 1854, a man named Andre-Adolphe-Eugene Disderi patented something called a &quot;carte-de-visite&quot; which is a portrait glued to a piece of cardboard the size of a traditional visiting card....like the ones forever being left on hallway trays in the novels of Edith Wharton and Henry James.There also terms and phrases we might have heard but, perhaps, did not understand fully like &quot;contact sheet&quot; or &quot;daguerreotype,&quot; &quot;The New York School&quot; or &quot;Photojournalism&quot; and &quot;Camera Obscura&quot; to name just a few.The book is crammed full of wonderful bits and pieces of information, interestingly written and invaluable for the photographer, the photography collector or the hobbyist.

2277,"Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and to the expense of Tobe Hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one. Englund plays the well known Marque De Sade who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain. The story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and I became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. All I saw was a young lady that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this Arabian with alot of money and finds out that he's out to have her killed and then Englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a descendent of the de Sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the Madam Momoselle(spelled that wrong) or whoever it was in the picture above De Sades wall. The movie was terrible, I am surprised at Hooper for hireing Englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable, especially the part about the eyes. Englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move ""Nightmare on Elm St."" by using these pull in and out needles to put out peoples eyes. Terrible, absolutely terrible.",movie

2280,"The simple points upon which this book is based might be much easier to understand today than when it was written, because a large part of the growth of the world economy has been based on the ideas about the growth of capital which this book assumed as the fundamental surplus value of economic activity. Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice. Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces. What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to ""the bad effects of the monopoly,"" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain. Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth. ""At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough."" The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.The current situation might be closer to ""the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse."" Near the end of Book IV, ""Of Systems of Political Economy,"" Chapter VII, ""Of Colonies,"" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be. ""In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade."" Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, "" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment."" Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances. Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity. When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it. This hardly makes more sense than those who expected seizure of everybody's major assets to solve society's problems.",book
2281,"The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s. Considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film, one wonders how it could have been so overlooked. This is a slow, moody, but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family. The film is more or less an indictment of Midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion. The film will not be for all tastes, but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it OK.<br /><br />In the early moments of the film, we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they're lucky. While climbing through a barbed wire fence, the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother. These boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course. The way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows: First man climbs through. Second man then passes him the gun through the fence. The first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence. At no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence.<br /><br />Anyway, once his brother is killed, 12-yr-old Arnold regresses into his own world. He does not even run for help after his brother is shot. He simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later. At no point during the funeral or inquest does Arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all. His family seems to shun him. Perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother. An ornery uncle played by Frederick Forrest is outwardly upset with Arnold, even though the older brother's death allows him to hit on the kid's girlfriend. Arnold's parents don't seem to understand how to deal with their son. They really don't even try to talk to him. About the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by Wilford Brimley. After a while, Arnold even moves in with the old timer.<br /><br />Nothing seems to get Arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to Reno Nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle's ex-wife. Once he meets her, he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the family's turmoil with the accident. From here on, the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening.<br /><br />The acting is hauntingly distant in most cases. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close make the perfect stoic farm parents. Forrest is good, but maybe trying too hard to channel Paul Newman's performance in Hud. The cinematography is exceptional, too. If you like moody pictures about common folk, this one may be for you. Some even may be advised to bring some tissues. 8 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.",movie

Puzzled, Paul wonders what is going on with his new neighbor.Eddie's sister, Sharon, 17 comes out and explains to Paul and the other kids that Eddie has autism.

Ward (""Major League"") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well. Second, besides the Grammer character, most of the crew provide some or plenty of the movie's humor, which is treated like a double-edged sword. Three members of the supporting cast - Harland Williams, Toby Huss, and Rob Schneider provide the funniest scenes, which includes weird gestures, impersonations, and, well, their personalities.<br /><br />""Down Periscope"" is more than a Navy version of ""Police Academy"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"".

2285,"Casual book browsers who stumble across Braden's book, ""The Isaiah Effect,"" might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title: that there exists some mystical, unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques, research, and understanding. I, as one such browser, had briefly read about the so-called ""Bible Code"" which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related. With my interest piqued at the title and the book description, I delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed Isaiah's ""precise instructions"" of prayer. I wanted to know exactly what Braden claimed to have stumbled upon.What I found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new-thought concepts. The mixing of religions, for example - a sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled over and over again, drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books. In only one chapter does Braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of Isaiah. Instead he relegates the books of the Essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence.In the brief pages in which Braden actually does discuss Isaiah, his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science. His basic premise of ""The Effect"" is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present. Such a revelation is not a new interpretation of Isaiah at all. Any student of the Bible and Christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the Old Testament are records of God warning Israel, and the world, of turning away from Him.To Braden's credit, his discussions of the effects of prayer in today's society are commemorable, albeit somewhat misguided. I agree with him that people in today's society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they've surrounded themselves. However, I believe Braden over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer. He fails to discuss how humans, and their emotions, are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes.Braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts. In the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created. Humbleness before God and the filling of the Holy Spirit are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human feelings.A disappointing read.",book

2287,"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.<br /><br />Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt lillard, granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. This is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film.<br /><br />Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)<br /><br />It's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film.<br /><br />The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies.

2290,"I started reading this book on my 16th birthday and didnt finish it until my 17th. Obviously I read many books in between, but I think it was just hard for me to follow and get into.After I started understanding the book a bit more as I randomly picked it up and put it down again, I fell in love with it.First of all, Zola did an excellent job in the development of Nana's character. At first, she is a prositute who is an actress and the book begins with one of Nana's performances at the theater. Her character completely captivated me and as Zola said ""even the slightest twitch of her finger can fill a man with desire"".As her story goes on, you really like Nana and respect her ambition and you highly dislike all the pathetic men who drool over her and the jealous women who bad-mouth her. When she has a difficult relationship you pity her. However, as you get closer and closer to the end you start to hate all the things she does, agree with the jealous women, feel bad for the poor men, and in turn despise her. It is only until you get closer to the end that you see that she has no heart, and all she lives for is to suck out everything materialistic from all the men who fall in love with her (which is a great many) and in turn suck out their souls. We praise Zola in the end for giving her exactly what she deserves.Zola also does a lot of portraying of the corruption of the high class French in the mid-1800s. At first it seems very stable and good, but, like Nana, the further you get to the end the more corruption and malfunction there is.I must say, the story really haunted me in a way after I finally finished reading it and I couldn't get my mind off it. But, does that show anything except that the book was an excellent read?I didn't give it a full five star rating for my own reasons, mainly because the book didn't exactly suck me in and it took me a year to read. I understand it's probably because of lack of comprehension becuase in the end I couldn't put it down.All in all, one of my favorites that I lend and recommend to all my friends. Enjoy.",book

I saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book?

I almost stopped it halfway through because I knew it wouldn't amount to anything but French guys trying to show-off.<br /><br />The film starts off promisingly, like some sort of expansive horror film, but it quickly shifts genres, from horror to action to x-files type to buddy flick, that in the end, CR is all of it and also none of it. It's so full of clich√©s that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue and those silent pauses, with fades outs and fades ins just at the right expositionary moments, made me groan. I thought only films made in Hollywood used this hackneyed technique.<br /><br />The chase scene, with Vincent Cassel running after the killer, is so over-directed and over-done that it's almost a thing of beauty.

The book is clearly aimed at baby boomers, like himself, who are struggling with meaning and unfulfilled career aspirations. Personally, O'Toole's writing got me to think more about the question of whether all vices are ""fun and exciting"" and all virtue is ""boring"".

2308,"and I still don't know where the hell this movie is going? I mean really, what is this movie about? Is it about demonstrating Sean Connery's complete lack of Arabic? Is it about showing that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord then he was a natural to play the role of Ramirez in highlander? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was there so much sand that was put to so little use? Where was there so much table slapping? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy who he was shooting archery with? Did he realize the man was Japanese? Why was no no credible excuse given for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether it be being raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), being raised on the bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier), or having a French mother and being raised in Indochina (I cannot even remember the name of that movie)? Can anyone explain this?",movie
2309,"In Christian Duguay's movie, Hitler: The Rise of Evil, Hitler's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration. It is quite natural for a Hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie. Even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book, I believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie, making it more interesting. We should not forget that this movie is not a documentary. Who cares how did his dog died anyway.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, Hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals. But he was not portrayed as a super-villain but more like an ambitious politician. I believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective. Yes he was a little mad, and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in ""Inglorious Bastards"". I believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts.<br /><br />The flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators. Even though the movie's focus was around Hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers, discussions of people and the songs in a Jewish cabaret. Also society's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited. Struggles of journalist Fritz Gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all. Mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him.<br /><br />Another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for Jews. In the beginning of the movie, some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial. All of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of Jews.<br /><br />In conclusion, Hitler: The Rise of Evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all. If you can stand directors that change history for cash, it is an interesting movie reflecting Hitler's personality in a successful way.",movie
2310,"I open &quot;Except for Me and Thee&quot; every time I find my life getting too hectic or complicated. The book has a strange, soothing effect on me as I join the Birdwells, who, as Quakers during the Civil War, face moral dilemmas and everyday hardships, yet manage to maintain a thoughtful serenity. The author has the rare ability to paint a picture *economically* with her words, and this reader has no desire to see a movie based upon the book, for fear it would ruin the images already stored in the mind. I was delighted to discover that there is a tremendous amount of subtle humor woven into the pages, which makes reading the book a truly bittersweet experience that reflects real life. It is interesting to contrast &quot;Except for Me and Thee&quot; with other classic books set in the same time period, such as &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; and &quot;Little Women&quot;.

2318,"The dead spots and picture-postcard superficiality of ""Out of Africa"" just about buried any interest I might have had to read Isak Dinesen. So when my brother bought me ""Babette's Feast,"" and knowing it was based on a Dinesen story, I didn't exactly race to the VCR. But as the titles rolled, it became clear that this was no ordinary movie. Jutland (where it's set) is not Africa; the chill mist that collects on the camera shots is not inviting. The cold, forbidding sea; the heavy, gray clouds; the pale, icy green cliffs--translate to hardships that show on the faces over which director Gabriel Axel draws the curtain. The craggiest is Bodil Kjer's as Philippa; amid the myriad merits of this movie, the most memorable is that face. It stands like a map laying before us the cherished wonder of her minister father's apostolate; like a maze of long-overlooked fjords where the complications of her congregation's perseverance and commitment hang like gleaming escutcheons.<br /><br />I gather it's Dinesen's point how the world is drawn inexplicably to Christian dedication, when Philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor (because he fears he'll never measure up to the rules and rigors of her small religious clique), and he returns to find her mistress of whom he regards as the greatest chef on the continent. I figure it's also her point that Christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give up worldly success (Philippa's sister Martina rebuffs efforts by a visiting baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont whose jolliness creates an uplifting counterpoint to the sparsity of spirit that surrounds his discovery) to turn her into an opera star; the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation and seeks sanctuary as the servant of two spinster sisters) to pursue artistic triumphs for only God and those closest to Him to witness. But it's Axel who weaves the asperity of these people's lives with the richness of Martina's voice and Babette Hersant's table and effects a sumptuousness you'd never expect from a movie about sacrifice, faith, and religious conviction.<br /><br />What sets this movie apart from other religious movies is its sly humor. ""Babette's Feast,"" that is, the banquet itself--a posthumous commemoration of the minister's 100th birthday--is a beautifully orchestrated clash of sensibilities that delivers comic moments by an ensemble of actors that are unparalleled in their subtlety. It's just this deft comedy that enriches the solemn sentiments at closing. Together they do something pious movies seldom do. They leave a believer tremulously hopeful and unexpectedly resolute and humbled.",movie

2323,"This book starts of well and had some insightful comments to make but renders itself questionable by being so over the top. While there are some thought provoking insights, the assumption that everyone who is a bad employee, everyone who's ever been in an accident (at fault or otherwise) anyone whose behavior deviates from what the author deems healthy is most likely abusing a substance seems a bit far fetched. I think the author forgets that we tend to find those people who share some of our worst qualities. Coming from both an alcoholic and an abusive family with a manic depressive parent, I have found a surprising number of people who have shared any one or more of these experiences. If I were to relate that to the world at large I would have to assume that 9 out of 10 women have been sexually assaulted and 75% of people have manic depressive relatives. This, of course is absurd. Does it mean these aren't rampant problems? Of course not, but by assuming the problem is more prevalent than it is, I cannot approach the subject rationally. Added to this (in my opinion) strong negative I also felt the statistical numbers he threw around were largely arbitrary. He all but said that his numbers were HIS assumption of the true numbers of alcoholics (or drug addicts as the case may be). Again and again it seems he ruins his credibility by making such rash assumptions. If he had approached it as a philosophical starting point to conversation, I might be less critical but instead I feel he's asking me to check all my friends' and colleges purses and briefcases for booze. He has obviously had some very unfortunate experiences with alcoholics and for that I feel deep sympathy for him, but creating a mentality of paranoia in his life may only lead to self fulfilling prophesies where he seeks out people who will let him down but validate his theories. I would hope that noone else would share this pessimistic view of life.",book

When a car drives by her every day, Andi begins to fantasize about a relationship with the driver. Until the day he stops, opens the door, and says ""Get in, gorgeous."" Frank is a lot older, and during their daily after-school meetings, he makes Andi feels beautiful, loved and wanted. Andi knows that she has to keep thier relationship a secret, because Frank could go to jail for the things that he does with her. And even when their relationship begins to take an unpleasant edge, Andi knows that she can never, ever tell.This book starts with a overheard, anonymous quote about statutory rape: ""Please, that girl knew exactly what she was getting into."" And this book neither proves nor disproves the quote. It shows a compelling and tragic portrait of a girl from a good neighborhood and a good family who falls below the radar. It is easy to see how Andi could be blinded by someone who made her feel special. What is more difficult is to understand how someone as smart as Andi could have gotten into the relationship in the first place, or have fallen for Frank's stories, or let it go on as far as it did. Even though the book is from Andi's perspective, it doesn't feel like we're in her head. I still don't understand how Andi got to where she got with Frank. It feels like you're watching from a distance. And at the end of the book, even though things have, in a way, changed, it's still difficult to see any change or growth in Andi. It's more like she narrowly avoided disaster than that she grew up enough to navigate clear of it.

Unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on. While the numbers certainly are the type that Hollywood did in their glory days, they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to weave action around them. This wouldn't be so bad if the music was half way decent, but its not. There is only one good song. Worse its as if the studio knew they had one song, Cocktails for Two, and we're forced to endure four versions of it: a duet, a big production number, as the Vanities finale and in the background as incidental music. I don't think Spike Jones and His City Slickers ever played it that much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglen sparring nicely with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistress.<br /><br />By no mean essential I can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers, or are willing to scan through them.

2332,"Stars Like Dust is the first of Asimov's Empire trilogy. The other two books are The Currents of Space and Pebble in the Sky. In Stars Asimov describes events immediately following the execution of a prominent political figure convicted of treason. His angry son Biron is the main protagonist of this novel. The ""enemy"" is a race known as the Tyranni who quickly subdued many formerly independent kingdoms and is taxing the heck out of them.Stars is short at less than 200 pages and easy to read, yet still gives lots to think about. For example, Asimov's portrayal of the vast distances between stars and the utter darkness within a dark nebula are convincing and fire the imagination. There are a couple good twists in the novel and all questions I had were resolved by the end. The ending hints at a rebellion soon to come that will create the Empire. I believe The Currents of Space is set in the new Empire.Stars also has a side plot about a secret document from Earth said to be the ultimate weapon against the Tyranns. We find out what this document is at the very end and I must say it's possibly the cheesiest ending to a sci-fi novel that I've ever read. Apparently Asimov himself hated it but was forced to incorporate this subplot by the editor. It kind of makes sense given that the book was published in the 1950s (read it to see what I mean).I haven't yet read the other two Empire novels or the Foundation series, but I did read the four-book Robot series. The final Robot novel, Robots and Empire, provides a satisfying link between the two series. Also, the first Foundation book (Prelude to Foundation) is chronologically after Pebble in the Sky, so the three series together compose a grand 14-book epic!Unfortunately the entire Empire series is out of print. This is a shame since Stars is definitely worth picking up and so are the other two from what I've heard....",book
2333,"This is bad movie. There is no denying it as much as I'd like to. Tommy Lee Jones is about as good as he possible can be with the script they gave him, and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place due to their acceptable quality.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line someone figured that all of the shortcomings of script could be counteracted if they were to hire every single workhorse actor in the business, unfortunately even truly, deeply talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and lest we forget Mr. Jones himself can't fix the wooden dialogue, and plot progression that went absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />In fact at one point I looked up, sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that I was 51 minutes into it.<br /><br />Perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost confederate soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story. Other than slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture. *if you haven't seen this movie disregard this past statement which may seem tantalizing and know that it is not, you will not understand it any better after having watched the movie.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie ""Heaven's Prisoners"" starring Alec Baldwin in the same role carried by Tommy Lee Jones in this movie.

This rich but ill woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Meditteranean, ruling over a put-upon staff when she's suddenly visited by this traveling poet, who mouths platitudes. In fact, the whole film is just a talk fest, with much of the talk making no sense. Even in 1968, no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense, and the passage of time makes that even more clear. If it weren't for the beautiful cinematography and scenery, it would deserve a negative rating. The only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars.",movie
2335,"In chapter 5 of 55, the consumptive son of the rich American banker in England shows the recently arrived poor cousin from America around the manor. When she asks if there are ghosts, he tells her: only unhappy people can see the ghost. May you never see it!This is then the main claim to suspense in this story. Will she see it?I am joking. It is not a ghost story, it is a comedy, of sorts. At least it starts as one, before getting stuck sometimes in a morass of ponderous seriousness and finally melancholic sadness. Before I started reading James ab ovo some time ago, I had not been aware that he was often a satirical writer. I remembered, from previous encounters, his language as being cumbersome. It isn't normally. Sure, there are the odd sentences that read as if they were constructed on purpose to keep trespassers out.This novel has an essential design flaw: it is far too long! What came over the man? His 7th novel stretches out to 600 pages, instead of the reasonable 200 of the previous ones. It was his first `big' novel. Hmm. Small is beautiful, Mr.James! We could bear it more easily if we liked the heroine. Then we could find an interest in her adventures more gladly. It is hard to stay for 600 pages with a less than fascinating character.This portrait of a lady turns out to be a rather long vivisection. The lady, Isabel Archer, enjoys little admiration from her literary father. It is not gentlemanly, Mr.James, to create a lady and then abuse her so, to have so much fun at her expense!Isabel is, allegedly, the nave American girl who gets abused by hordes of profiteers of all kind. She is nave alright, in a similar way as Daisy Miller: an alien in her social circles, independent and non-integrated, emotional but with a lack of emotional intelligence, self-educated but with little understanding of the world.James uses her views of England as if she were a savage fresh out of the jungle on her first visit to the big city.She is an anti-heroine. She is a defenseless victim of James's sadism: he calls her names page after page. She was `spoiled and neglected' by her useless but adored father. She is `a person of many theories, her imagination is always active'. She is `liable to the sin of self-esteem'. She has an `unquenchable desire to think well of herself'. She `would be an easy victim to scientific criticism, if she were not intended to awaken on the reader's part an impulse more tender...'. See, now James pokes fun at us readers as well! This is going too far!HJ doesn't leave it to us to judge his creature, but he tells us loudly and clearly what we have to think of her. At least that seems to be what happens, until we start thinking about the gaps in his lecture. The gaps of course may be James' own gaps, not just Isabel's. Does she have a sex life? Did James?Only after she had her personal Waterloo, after she has been dragged down by the monsters, is James beginning to be gentle with her. I have noticed before, in other stories of his, that he sympathizes with the rebellious woman only when she loses.The plot is based on an old woman's spleen that she must introduce her sister's youngest daughter, an orphan, to society in Europe and `do something' for her. The girl is not wealthy, but then, out of nowhere, her uncle leaves a lot of money to her and she can consider herself rich.And then we find ourselves trapped into disapproving her rejection of a couple of very respectable suitors: James has played with us. We are conditioned to take Isabel for a fool, and when she rejects the glorious Warburton and the grandiose Goodwood, we ascribe it to her idiocy. After these rash acts, life slows down for a while, and with it the book.The introduction of Isabel's American lady friend, the meddlesome, insanely aggressive journalist Henrietta, constitutes an outbreak of Jamesian warfare against women. This is probably James' most misogynistic novel, at least so far in my Jamesian diet. Henrietta is an outright alien, a person from the moon as far as James' normal societies and environment are concerned. Was he taking revenge on the profession or the sex?Another female ogre is the mysterious and cultivated Mrs. Merle, a mistress of intrigue and falsity. Near half time in the novel, she turns on the screw and plots Isabel's entrapment by a bad guy, cynical Mr.Osmond. The story gathers steam again, we begin to fear for Isabel. James has not made her ridiculous enough for us not to wish her to escape from this hell hole.Osmond has a daughter who is 15 when we meet her. She is painted like an absurd underdeveloped child, as if she were 10. A totally false character. The novel is full with false women. Let's face it, even the aunt is false, with her rude snobbishness. Has something happened to good old Henry? Did the girls scare him?",book

I guess it's not for everyone because it's basically Kafka's ""The Trial"" meets ""Beevis and Butt-Head"", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. Still, I thought it was great. If you're going to see it because you want a sequel to Office Space you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, acid-tongued, and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed you're in for a treat. I just saw the 8pm show opening night in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the film will probably be gone in a week. That's really a shame because, in its own way, Idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while.

This is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling. In short, it's no different from 90% of Hollywood product. But it's the racial angle that makes 'Set It Off' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making. Posing as a celebration of 'sistahood', the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating Afican-American 'gangsta' stereotype. The gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. Worse, 'Set It Off' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. Serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then they're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring, guilt-ridden liberals (tell that to Rodney King), and aspirational 'good' sista, Jada Pinkett Smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the 'hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend. 'Set It Off' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the 'hood while all the time despising it. While the likes of 'Shaft' and 'Superfly' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. 'Set It Off' wouldn't be worth getting angry over if wasn't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of African-American film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s.",movie
2342,"We went to Bettlecat over the weekend for some Lobster Rolls and delicious drinks. The host and hostess were super friendly and helpful.  It was about a 30 min wait on a Saturday night for 5 people. Not bad at all. Once we were sat down it took about 10 mins until we were helped. Seemed like there was a lot of confusion in the air. We went ahead and ordered our food, water, and someone ordered a cocktail. Once she got her drink my friend and I ordered ours. Our food came out super quickly which was great because we were starving. But We had to wait on our cocktails for about 25 mins. Throughout that time we told about 3 people we were waiting on it. I really want to leave a great review because the food was phenomenal but that 25 minute wait for an $11 drink was crazy and really upset me.",restaurant
2343,"SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness. Naturally, when the enemy discovers his ruse, the soldier darts straight for the forest. The ensuing chase is a visual marvel: Chaplin not only hides the soldier from the Germans, but he uses the forest to mask the soldier from the audience, as well, such that the camouflaged soldier stands unblocked in the middle of the frame yet somehow remains invisible. All the while we thought our little hero was pulling a fast one on the German army; to our delight, the joke is on us, too.<br /><br />Rating: 8",movie

Yet, I have always found it fairly enjoyable to watch this redneck romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley's and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, mechanical bull riding, and -of course- the required brawls.

More period samurai epics than anything else, these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. There's not a single facet of these gems that is unpolished, from the scenario(s) to the performances to the filmmaker's craftsmanship. Even the special effects are handled with well-above-average skill, and are integrated (in most instances) almost seamlessly into the movie(s). If you're a GOJIRA fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre, I highly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.",movie
2348,"I have passed this restaurant a million times and never had as desire to check it out. However, my beau wanted  to dine on some home cooked food and this girl was not in the mood to be cooking! After a quick Google search I found this place! 

We parked at the back of this restaurant which is the to go area that includes a bar that is priced by the pound. We had to walk through the restaurant to be seated. We were quickly seated at a window table for two. Our server came over promptly. She lacked a personality but she got her job done. 

I ordered a veggie plate, and the boo ordered a pork chop plate.  The  food took a while to come out. I don't understand why restaurants pretend to cook food to order. Let's be real, the sides  and bread are not made to order. It is possible that the pork chop was made to order but still no reason for the extended wait time.  The food  actually tastes pretty good. I do have to make this statement: this is not your grandmas kind of cooking. The food  is somewhat bland, but I like that. I don't like southern cooking loaded with salt.  

If you need a quick fix for a home cooked meal I would recommend this place. You can take it home and add a little seasoning and it will be perfect!

While there may be what are perhaps considered glaring inconsistencies, the film portrays a spirit that is unique to Australia, and one that should be cherished. If anything, this mini-series demonstrates the Aussie sense of humour. The ability to laugh at the supremely ridiculous. Our willingness to have a laugh in even the most dire of situations. While a large part of this series focuses on mateship and how humour can be used as a means of survival, it also has elements of drama that are evoke real emotions.

The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine.

2361,"Characters' repulsion to Mary Smith's bimbo mode provided effervescent entertainment. The widow's bulb was dimmed to such a degree, I was surprised she wasn't irritating to me. Instead, she was such a spot-on portrayal of similar women I've observed (especially with the ""I really, really"" speech pattern) that when she entered a discussion, chuckles emerged from too vivid recalls of ""been there"" with personal periodic dips into the low wattage of exhaustion. As Parker had intended, I was baited into the complex plot by continuing to question if Mary's ""act"" was an act, or face-value of her unadulterated self.For my tastes, Parker mastered several techniques of the novel and of P.I. genre expectations in WIDOW'S WALK, # 29 in this series. The plot was intriguingly complex, and multiple unusual arrangements (and murders) in this novel worked, with dues to realism paid on accounts. In particular, I enjoyed the empathetic scenes with Race Witherspoon in his art studio and gay bar connections (Nellie's in Bay Village).An overview of the evolution of Parker's writing style seemed to crystalize somewhat with the reading of WIDOW, as I began noticing a few cracks forming in a conclusion I'd been solidifying through reviews of 31 Spenser novels (see my Listmania). Surprisingly, this observation delighted me, because it meant that Parker's skill was more intriguingly complicated than I had thought. Of course I'm glad I caught the error in my ""headings"" prior to pontificating them here. My other reviews' observations still read accurately from my current conclusions, since each review focused on the immediate book, and sometimes a few around it in sequence.As I read onward in WIDOW, a light bulb swung into my path and bopped me between the eyes. ""Oh!"" (To use a British term from Christie's Miss Marple series.) As the bulb bopped, I saw that this series does not precisely evolve in progressive increments from a denser style narrated by a solitary P.I. into a lighter, sparser, team-playing home-stretch, as I had hypothesized when contrasting the earlier books to POTSHOT (the first novel I read in the series) and a few of the later offerings. Parker's talent is too rich and quirky for a simple, incremental, no-back-tracking progression.As soon as my previous reviews had identified a shift in the series style-continuum, I'd read the next offering and see that the ""shift"" had returned to an earlier mode, with a new flair or flavor. Sometimes the shift went from teaming with Hawk or Susan (which I thought had become a new approach), back to the solitary Spenser, lonely-street, melancholy P.I. of the earlier novels. The only accurate style-shifting synopsis might be to conclude that honing and paring of every asset in this series has been primely accomplished.A few chapters into WIDOW, I had paused to thumb through the book, checking the balance of pages of dialogue clips, to pages of longer paragraphs of solitary contemplations, descriptions of setting and weather, etc. That quick thumb gave a false conclusion that THIS was the line of demarcation for a dramatic increase in the jazzy ""talking head"" rhythm, and a decrease in action, and density of setting/narrative.Even though I reveled in the earlier density, I felt (still do) that Parker was one of the few authors able to rivet readers into abundances of sequential pages of dialogue, with the repartee having such a rich rhythm as to feel like plot motion as much as skull-cracking-action does. Yes, dialogue flared well in WIDOW. Yet, pared-down weather descriptions, scenery enhancements, and mood reports were woven whimsically around repartee. Thankfully, here is where I caught myself wrongly assuming that this would become forevermore the ""New Deal.""A variety of literary pizzazz and style panache has been sporadically alternated in this series, creating a collection of upwardly spiraling, ""new and improved"" machinations in no discernible pattern of progression, other than possibly from denser to more effervescent, though both styles work. As noted above, Parker appears to be alone in having the repartee ramble down with enough spark-padded-with-spit-of-sensual-observation to carry a novel without a plethora of heavy-action-backup (though action has continued to abide in good pace throughout the series).What caused the shifts in style in this series? Might Parker's editor have astutely isolated patterns of reader response which indicated a regular appeal or repel? About Parker's dialogue, other than the use of ""he said/she said"" (which delights me in seeming to be a rebellious signature), I've read mostly raves reported with rhapsodic rhetoric.Complaints have surfaced about other literary assets, and supposed liabilities. Praise has clashed with complaints, with both seeming to relate to personal preference. Possibly Parker, in the vein of many authors of fiction, rides with the series more than micro-designing or reining it. A few of Parker's early blog entries on Amazon briefly mention means of choosing of particular characters, themes, or styles.Whatever impacted this series as it moved through its courses, it is a prime offering in culturally significant literary contributions, all the more so in its guise of being formulaic, simple entertainment. Don't be slighted by a smooth flow of style and a degree of genre adherence ... or do be!Thumbs up to Parker's entertainingly erratic evolution of style,Linda ShelnuttAuthor of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts, including:Molasses Moon",book

However, this was a movie as a child that I was a fervent admirer of; keeping in mind now that it was made for children, I rate it on a relative basis. The story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort, and jostling back-'n-forth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions, as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons. If I had children, this definitely is a film I would try and get them interested in, as the snow fort wowed me when I was young, and I think even children today would agree, albeit with Pixar and all the computer animation, maybe I am out of date and just don't realize it. In addition, the movie's message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that, for children (and adults alike).",movie
2366,"The St. Francisville Experiment claims ""this ain't no walk in the woods"", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.<br /><br />Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming!!<br /><br />I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's ""paranormal consultant"" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie. Should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and all shall be told.<br /><br />Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know... He informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. Matter of fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (notice I didn't say good...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER.<br /><br />What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax. The amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. Filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as ""surround yourself with the white light"" and ""I love the ghosts"", The St. Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and chant ""I love the ghosts!""<br /><br />Talk about false advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted house. From the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying Madison, from the ""seance"" which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed, The St. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie.

So needless to say I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long while. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's ""Return of the Living Dead"", but whereas that film was intentionally funny, this one is the opposite. It has some of the most laughable acting I've ever witnessed, especially from the main scientist character. His scenes with the General were just hysterical. Also, the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy, and the death scenes are often just downright stupid. This, of course, makes it all the more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head, which then opens its eyes and somehow FLIES OUT OF THE FRIDGE (obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string), latching onto the guys neck, killing him. Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It defies every law of physics known to man, and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed.

2373,"I have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie, and I understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about Ponyo, whether it be the story line, animation, dialogue, and so forth. And I believe the most simple way I can answer to this, is that it's a movie for a much, much younger age bracket. An age bracket much younger than that of Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro).<br /><br />Being a Miyazaki fan like the majority of the surfers on this site, I expected the wonderful animation, music composition, complex story telling, the great steady development of characters, how the story intertwines with today's society, etc etc etc of a typical Miyazaki film that we grew up with. And to tell you the truth, I didn't quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was going on until an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes left in the movie), that this movie is NOT for the deep thinkers and hard core Ghibli-ists, but for the toddlers and youngins' and happy go lucky Japanese people. Also, I believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation; straight-up grass roots Ghibli Studios style. <br /><br />The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, other than the father and maybe that crazy-ass typhoon. But other than that, this movie is just plain fun; to stimulate a young one's mind, and to make happy good time feeling. That's all. <br /><br />The animation goes back to the old-school mid-80s early-90s era of Miyazaki's films, where very specific detail wasn't a big focus, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the latter. I admire the simplicity which kind of created some small nostalgia when I first watched Ghibli movies like Tonarino Totoro when I was a child. The reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to that of kids, and a lot of Studio Ghibli's body language is very noticeable. Studio Ghibli added some creative moments and sceneries that they can only do with it's wonderful animators, but it probably won't take the ritual Ghibli-ist in awe.<br /><br />The Japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and a lot of scenes and dialogues are very, very relative from what Japanese kids and mothers would say and act. The music if very hoppy and ""fluffy"" I guess you could say (similar to Totoro) from beginning to end. Even the darker scenes didn't seem assertive.<br /><br />In the end this movie is one of a kind. Just about every aspect of this movie is for children. And I waited a whole 80 mins to realize that. Quite frankly, I have never seen a movie told or shown it the way Miyazaki did. It's refreshing to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story for a wider, and much different scale of audience, and still keep that trademark Ghibli impression.",movie

Are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever? Will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome? The subtle fact that the aged Ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters.<br /><br />The cinematography for Evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in Ann's mind as she recalls the past, and for that reason I think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed, to give everyone an ethereal glow (and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real, but occurred in the past). Claire Danes is beautiful (appearing to be really, really tall, though just 5' 5"" in reality), and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test.<br /><br />You can't really talk trash about the cast, which leads off with Claire Danes and doesn't let up from there: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film.<br /><br />I can't really say anything negative about this film at all, though Hugh Dancy's struggle to have his character emerge from utter one-dimensionality is in the end a total loss. Playing the spoiled, lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn't offer much in the way of character exploration - he had his orders and stuck to them.<br /><br />In the end, gentlemen, your lady friend will most certainly weep, and while you'll likely not feel nearly as affected, the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching Evening. Catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo flick. It'll be your little secret that this viewing didn't really cost you much at all.",movie

Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!<br /><br />Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away. This dialogue might've worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.<br /><br />If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.<br /><br />This script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. It simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.<br /><br />IMDB does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled ""weighted score"". Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.<br /><br />Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn't character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. That's a plot contrivance.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, watch it muted.

we went around 8pm and had a hard time finding an open seat so keep that in mind if you choose to go!

the salad could have been prepared a little bit better! i found that one had all the bacon and cabbage while the other had all the scallops! maybe 2 shrimps in the whole salad. could have been mixed a bit better but it was phenomenal and refreshing! 

for dinner i got the days catch which was sword fish! topped with garbanzo beans and a cumin citrus white sauce what packed a whole lot of flavor! the other dinner entree was the short ribs! also another amazing dish! so tender you could have ate it with a spoon! it was topped over a side of horseradish mashed potatoes so it was a lot fluffier than regular. finished with a drizzle or ale sauce! 

for dessert we got fried pbj bites which were better than the whole mean and a slice of cinnamon pie!

2394,"By far, this is Remarque's best work. His writing style is much more mature than in All Quiet and the themes, while similar, are far more complex. Anyone interested in PTSD should read this book--from the nightmares to the flashbacks, Remarque has it all here. The vividness is such that I find it difficult to imagine that he himself did not experience something close to what he describes. Ultimately, Remarque is interested in showing those who did not serve in war what the true consequences are for those who did. In All Quiet, the emphasis was the life of the trench soldier. In The Road Back, he focuses in on the failures of soldiers to reintegrate into life. Along the way, Remarque criticizes the bourgeoisie, the upper classes, the war profiteers, the petty officials, and the REMFs. In the end, he finds meaning for the veterans in just being useful, but then, this is not enough to stop the renewed militarism which leads to the Nazis--something Remarque acknowledges.

I have been eating there since it first opened in the 90s and never had a burger from them before. We only do takeout still or some finish at home meals from another Big Red F so we tried the green chile cheeseburger and the chicken enchilada plate. Both were good and we'd order again. 

The only glitch was the online order app. It would not checkout my cart and then clear my order. So I finally just called and placed the order by phone.

Now Gordon is afraid that his secret will come out, hurting his chances at winning the election and ruining his marriage. Gordon is willling to do anythign to keep that from happening.Ellie Acton was a bit unsure about hiring Theresa, this is an important summer for her because she is writing her doctoral thesis and needs complete concentration. She doesn't think that this is the best time to change babysitters. However, in the end she concedes and despite what she originally believed, she finds that Theresa is a godsend.

2403,"Destiny Restored is a wake-up call. It's a gripping tale about a group of Americans in the near future who recognize that their country has been taken from them. But the means of restoration are at hand, made possible by a convergence of the best in the human spirit and the pace of techological innovation.Jeremiah Jackson is a sympathetic protagonist, an aging intelligence officer fighting the triple demons of terrorism, his failing marriage, and his failing country. But his deductive skills are as sharp as ever. He weaves his way through a maze of suspicious characters who are planning a cataclysm, and he finds redemption in the end for the good guys, himself, and his own relationship.The novel presumes to reach wide, and it succeeds. It is action, mystery, history, social commentary, and love rolled into one. It is hope grown from hopelessness. The reader readily identifies with the reasons for Jackson's emotional downcasts, and then accompnaies him on his struggles to solve an intricate intelligence puzzle. Along the way the reader gasps at revelations of the inhumane audacity of the bad guys, marvels at the clever application of new technology, and wonders all the while at how and why this country has abandoned so much good in the span of mere generations. And finally, the reader nods with approval at the courage and selfless commitment of the individual.The astute reader quickly picks up references to Ayn Rand, Alexis deToqueville, Cato the Elder, and others, but the truly discerning reader enjoys discovering subtler allusions to Allan Bloom and certain contemporary celebrities.Destiny Restored's timeliness is also remarkable, projecting global terrorism and the worsening culture wars as the chief threats to America's survival as we know it. But the epic backdrop doesn't smother the personal interactions. Particularly moving scenes include the good-bye from a loving daughter to her parents, the display of humanity exhibited by the diverse group of adventurers at the point of their embarkation, and the pouring out of two good people's individual feelings as they struggle to survive, and revive, a failed marriage. To say nothing of a surprising, redemptive reconciliation at book's end.Completing the emotional spectrum is good old-fashioned excitement. Here are saboteurs caught and uniquely punished, a chase, a dogfight, and even an out-of-body experience.It's a great read.",book
2404,"This is truly a re-make that should never have gotten out of the stable. It has two casts that are acting in entirely different strata. At the top of their game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. Every nuance of the Franks is in plain sight. at the rock bottom are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I cannot imagine how Schell and Plowright manage to play so well when Gilbert and Roberts are working their anti-magic. Gilbert ruins every scene she's in. It's like Father Knows Best in the Ghetto. She's Ann Frank light. Her run at Helen Keller was thin but not awful. This is sacrilege. Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Damm merely annoying. She is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious, dissatisfied presence caused so much trouble in het Acherhuis. This needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to voluptuous. Her weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright could have played this part beautifully. Roberts was on a career high when this was made, getting lots of press and many opportunities. Her performance here displays her weaknesses as an actress shamefully.<br /><br />James Coco and Clive Reville, have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts , and , strong though they are, they are completely incapable of undoing the damage done by their partners. Reville is a wily actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by Ed Wynne in the original film. He gets no support from Gilbert . She drain the color out of every scene. <br /><br />I've read with dismay the comments by those of you who grew up watching this version, filled with attachment to these performances. It's a lesson in how the version you see first attachs to you. It makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to watch the original.

I felt the film's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot. Instead, it was composed of (too) many sub-plots competing for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment. What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact any one sub-plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film.

This section is intended to shed some light on common problems that occur while trying to evangelize our world but it also lets each one of us potentially see ourselves and our own efforts in a new light.The book brings up the topic of servant evangelism. ""Small things done with great love will change the world"". This quote can be seen on the front of the Vineyard Community Church in Cleveland, Ohio and is a consistent theme throughout the book.Together Sjogren, Ping, and Pollock have put together a wonderful collection of illustrations that make each point clear and understandable from those who are new to the faith or even old pros at evangelism.Almost the last half of the book focuses on new techniques intended to allow their practitioners to feel at ease with the process of evangelism.The four major chapters of Active Kindness, Active Friendship, Active Wondering, and Active Sharing, each introduce an easy to participate in concept that anyone can partake of and employ. The great thing about each of these is that they can be done as a natural extension of living your life.This book was a great read because it was easy to understand and it also gave me topics to think about in my own evangelism efforts. Everyone can always benefit from learning something they did not know or even something they already knew explored in a new and fresh way.This book is a great addition to any Christian's library or anyone wanting to learn more about basic evangelism techniques.-- Jeffrey R.

If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film. It also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly. So why does Hollywood keep making junk like this?

Country girl Rebecca goes to wild California to attend college, only to be assaulted by the lifestyle. 'Resident Adviser' ""Crawl"" helps her settle in, and soon the two are good friends. Bec decides to bring the wacky ""Crawl"" home for Thanksgiving, with obvious ""fish out of water"" results.<br /><br />The only other comic angle Steve Rash (aptly named ) achieves here is a sexual one. This he bludgeons us with, but to no avail. Both comic aspects fail dismally, and you know the film is groping when ""Crawl"" hijacks the combine harvester and writes his name in the corn field.<br /><br />Dramatically the movie falls short too, with several attempts at family and personal counselling from ""Crawl"" misfiring. Between them Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast are mere fodder. The problem is it's nearly impossible to actually like ""Crawl"", and you'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why Rebecca would want to spend a moment with him.

I had hoped for the best, but instead, was delivered a boring Nordic soap-opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time. The film's premise is intriguing enough: It's about a Viking warlord who defies his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live enraged, insane, and violent lifetime after lifetime. The movie is filmed competently enough, with some rich cinematography and quasi-good performances by the actors, but again, I found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end. The filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi-unique but they dropped the ball. Perhaps it could've been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore... I mean, we are talking about ""Berserkers"" here, aren't we? Vikings were supposed to be BAD enough, what with all the raping and pillaging, so aren't Berserkers supposed to be even more extreme? All in all, unless you're a fan of The Young and Restless (etc...) or, are yourself, in fact, an insane Berserker who likes self torture, I'd probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid.",movie

2428,"I was surfing through IMDb one day, when I stumbled across ""The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird."" Noticing how obscure it was, I decided to set off looking for it. Thanks to Digiview, it didn't take me long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I got home, I watched it, although I must say, I was quite impressed.<br /><br />Three of the paintings in a king's apartment, a shepherdess, a chimney sweep, and a self-portrait of the king (who is just as selfish and sadistic as the actual king himself) come to life one night while the king is sleeping. The shepherdess and the chimney sweep escape, while the painting of the king calls the police in order to capture the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird comes in to help them, often mocking the police and the king.<br /><br />The back of the DVD case describes this film as ""a surreal visual delight and an underrated entry in the history of classic animation."" I couldn't agree more with it, considering that much of the backgrounds look rather bizarre, and many of the characters are weird, which include the depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions that are calmed by the music of a blind man (who kind of looks like Andy Warhol), not to mention Mr. Wonderbird himself is somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and mostly fun to watch, and its only flaw is that it can be slow moving. But overall, this film was very good, and it comes recommended by yours truly.<br /><br />Grade: B+ (Awesome)",movie
2429,"In ""Breakup"", Stabenow stresses humor and characters more than violence, to an extreme not found in any of her other books to date. The style is reminiscent of the earlier works of long-time Alaskan Tom Bodett, which were based on the fictional ""End Of The Road"", in Alaska. By the end of the first chapter, I decided that ""Breakup"" was a tribute to Mr. Bodett, and sat back to enjoy the ride.Stabenow's strength has always been her character development, backed by her panorama of the changing (and often conflicting) lifestyles of Alaska, with its mix of pavement-bound city dwellers, bush rats, and native americans. Throw in the Alaskan outback and the state's colorful history, stir in reasonable plots, and you've got a winning combination.",book

2431,"Shame, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and wife named Jan, and Eva. They live on an island working as farmers. There is a war going on and soldiers start attacking people on the island. Once the war subsides a little Jan, and Eva are arrested as going along with the opposite side. Once released even more trouble ensues and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. Winner of The CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards, The Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Liv Ullman, who plays Eva) at The Guldbagge Awards, The NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress at The National Board Of Review and The NSFC Award for Best Actress, Best Director (Ingmar Bergman) and Best Film at The National Society Of Film Critics Awards. Shame, has good direction, a good script, good performances by both Max Von Sydow (who plays Jan) and Liv Ullman (who plays Eva), good cinematography and good production design. Shame, is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive. The film has a powerful message and is a good film. The reason I'am not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other Ingmar Bergman films like Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal or Persona, for example. The film didn't have as big an impact on me as I thought it would and it lacked Ingmar Bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialog. While nowhere close to being one of his best films there is still a lot to like about Shame, and it is a good movie. I just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other Bergman masterpieces.",movie
2432,"What this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately with disjointed storytelling, frustrating plot-holes, and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly ""the greatest monster movie ever."" <br /><br />Let's start with the good stuff: comedy, acting and special effects. From the get-go, this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky. The opening scene - the monster's origin - is campy and quick, paying homage the the classic 'environmental' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. The pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action. With in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why', 'where,' and 'how' of the beast and are ready for action. In this the movie delivers.<br /><br />After another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, kind grandfather, and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. The characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work. <br /><br />The monster it's self looks great: alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid. The effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it's strings.' Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those in it's path. When the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel.<br /><br />Following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. Plot-lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. <br /><br />As for the comedy, let me say this: I'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. However, as an Asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years (still here) I'd like to think I have a better grasp on Asian humor than the average white-guy. That being said there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, weren't. <br /><br />*********** SPOILER************* For example: after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral; everyone is mourning. A new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. They both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. This competition is, at it's core, funny: two brothers who dislike each-other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in Asian comedy. This subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but, seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** END SPOILER **************<br /><br />Then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained, or, worse, are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. Finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you'd expect some comment to that nature. Instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti-climax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. So I ask you: why even bring it up in the first place? <br /><br />This was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. Of course introducing new and greater problems is a time-tested story telling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead it was as if you get several stories, each only explained 20% of the way and, in the end, the parts never converge to complete the whole.<br /><br />Again, I'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' Maybe its in Korean story- telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. Maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every-page, but never finishes one. Maybe it's OK to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.",movie
2433,"Thanks to silly horror movies like ""Troll"" and the indescribably atrocious cult-favorite ""Troll 2"", it has become practically impossible to take movies with kobolds, gnomes and various other types of little green hobgoblins seriously these days. Only just recently I watched the 70's made-for-TV movie ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"", which is basically a quite terrifying and serious-toned film about domestic little goblin monsters, and yet I still couldn't help thinking back about the laugh-inducing potato headed critters dressed in garbage bags that were running amok in ""Troll 2"". Same thing happened to me now. As much as I tried going into ""Inhabited"" with a clear mindset, unconsciously I kept comparing the supposedly creepy and menacing garden fairies with the badly sculptured goblins of Nilbog! Still, even without all the prejudices, ""Inhabited"" is a remotely entertaining albeit unmemorable straight-to-video horror flick. It's a cheesy, soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and Northern Europe mythology. The annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie aren't your plain average goblins; they are ""The Huldre"": wicked little Norwegian demons that live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through influencing the youngest children. This overcomes the Russell family as they move into their ramshackle dream house in a remote little town. The cherubic blond daughter of MILF-actress Megan Gallagher starts to behave strangely whenever she hangs out in the cute play house in the back of the garden. She claims her friends are fairies, and even though the sinister handyman also warns for strange occurrences in the past, Gina's parents simply think the girl has troubles adjusting to her new neighborhood. When she keeps rattling about fairies, they arrange an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist Dr. Werner whilst ""The Huldre"" are slowly coming out of their botanical shelter. Not much special to mention here. The pace is acceptable and the attempts to build up suspense are pretty cute. You understand this is a family-friendly horror movie, so no bloody murder sequences are graphically being shown here. Heck, even the cadaver of the family's pet cat is kept off-screen. This is the umpteenth nonsensical horror movie in which Malcolm McDowell pops up and he practically always depicts an unreliable, greedy and self-centered authority figure.",movie

But this book read so matter-of-factly, that I was losing my mind with boredom! I understood that Ron Williamson loved baseball and was going to be the next Mickey Mantle and all, but how many times did this have to be mentioned? How many times did the author have to say that after 2 months on his own, Ron had to be committed again, or Ron committed himself only to leave early, or Ron's sister came to get him or his mother let him stay with her? It read like a blow by blow police report that was too tedious for me to complete. I couldn't stand it anymore! The author had Ron slipping so deeply into manic depression that there was nowhere left for him to go so, the author took the story around again! Also, there was no depth of characters, no glimpse into the real killer's mind, no building up to a final conclusion. I was highly disappointed. John Grisham should stick to fiction.

2441,"Watching John Cassavetes film, Opening Night, I was reminded of something that Quentin Tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting. He referred to an example of, say, if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it wouldn't be the end of his life but that it would affect him, and that, without a doubt, he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy. ""Otherwise,"" as he said, ""what am I doing?"" I couldn't help but think of his words when watching Gena Rowland's character, Myrtle Gordon, who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario. There is more to this in Cassavetes' film, of course, since it's about how the theater works around a star actress, what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character, and how one lives when all one has (like Myrtle Gordon) is the theater.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the film, after exiting a performance, Myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named Nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to Myrtle. It's a touching little moment, but it doesn't last as she has to get in the car (pouring rain and all). She then watches in horror as the girl, who stood right next to the car as it drove off, gets hit by another car in an auto accident. She's not sure really what happened, but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit. From then on she's sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it's out of her system. At first this shows in small ways, like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor (played by Cassavetes) and can't seem to stand being hit - she blames it on the lack of depth in the character (the writer: ""What do you think the play lacks?"" ""Hope,"" says Myrtle)- but then Nancy starts to show up to her, an apparition that to Myrtle is all to real, until she's suddenly gone.<br /><br />Cassavetes, as in the past films, is after a search for what it means to have emotion, to really feel about something and feel it, or the lack thereof, and how it affects others around the person. This isn't exactly new ground for Rowlands, who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in Woman Under the Influence (in that case because of alcohol), nor would it be alien territory for costar Ben Gazzara, who just came off starring in Killing of a Chinese Bookie. But the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene; Cassavetes doesn't tell them how to get from A to B in a scene, and he doesn't need to. There's a mood in a Cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera-work. You know Myrtle, for example, should be content somehow, even if it isn't with the plot. But she's haunted, and is unsatisfied with her character's lack of depth and the tone of the play (""Aging, who goes to see that?"" she asks the playwright), and it starts to affect those around her too.<br /><br />The question soon becomes though not what is the usual. A conventional dramatist would make the conflict 'Will she be able to go on stage, will the show go on?' This isn't important for Cassavetes, even if it's there, as is the question 'Will she be alright?' Perhaps going through such a grueling play as ""The Second Woman"" could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality (seeing Sara and attacking her in front of total strangers, who wonder what the hell is going on)? Or will the play's lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her? The depths Rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing, and that it's expected doesn't mean it's any duller than Woman Under the Influence- if anything, it's just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession, and consequently the other performances are just as true, from Gazarra to Nancy played by a subtle Laura Johnson. Cassavetes answers to his own posed questions aren't easy.<br /><br />One of the real thrills of Opening Night, along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script, is to see Cassavetes take on the theater the way he does. We see the play performed- and it's apparently a real play- and we only know slightly what it's about. When we see the actors on the stage performing it, we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on (relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence) and the improvisation of the actors. I wondered watching how much really was improvised, how much Cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where Myrtle starts to go loopy or, in the climax, is completely smashed. He's on the stage, too, so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen.<br /><br />It's funny, startling, chilling, and edge-of-your-seat stuff, some of the best theater-on-film scenes ever put in a movie, and we see the lines between actor on stage, actor on film, actor with actor, blur together wonderfully. Opening Night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness, reality and fiction, where the love is between people, and really, finally, what does 'acting' mean?",movie

If you really want to see how this sort of ""homage"" can work, check out ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra""--It's clever, well-written, and best of all, performed by actual actors who aren't such agony to watch. For that matter, seek out the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson whose Sci-Fi short ""The Attack of the 70 foot Courtesy Lady"" leaves this film in the dust.

A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget of Waters' films has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that ""trailer-park"" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a quite life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the always watchable Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worst. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality.

2446,"One of the best lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies. It's gritty, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart, which can't be said about many of the movies this kind. I can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the time this movie was done. The scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old ""from the crypt"" kind of scenes. With a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking. The simple, yet effective ending specially shows how these things are treated right by those who can.<br /><br />The excellent cast were mostly unknown to me, except L. Q.

With that voice and skill he is one of the greatest loonies in movies, for me anyway.

My go-tos meats on tacos and quesadilla : asada + beef fajita and tinga (chicken). You can do 1/2 half on the large quesadilla or try a mini one depending on your hunger level. The mexican rice is some of the best I've had and it's a nice side, even if you just stick to the tacos.

2448,"Charlie Wilson's War, based on a true story, tells the tale of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to secure funding for covert support of the Mujaheddin in 1980s Afghanistan following the USSR invasion of the country. This conflict played a major role in the final years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR.<br /><br />In terms of film making, Charlie Wilson's War is a definite winner. It well-written, well-acted, and well-shot. While most of the attention has gone to Tom Hanks for yet another fine performance, I was even more impressed with Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as CIA operative Gust Avrakotos. Scenes of Soviet attacks on under-armed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart. The film also gives a good behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and dealing that Congressman Wilson must go through to secure the desired funding.<br /><br />There are, however, two complaints I have about the film. The first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well-developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line. The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war. The film makes the Mujaheddin look like innocent victims, and while they did suffer large civilian casualties, the Mujaheddin were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of Afghanistan. This government, ignored entirely in the film, not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion, later calling on the Soviet Union for support in their effort. The film also ignores that the US was aiding the Mujaheddin prior to the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions -- consequences we are still feeling today -- but it seems as if screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative. (Not having read the book, I do not know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Those complaints notwithstanding, I did enjoy watching Charlie Wilson's War and do recommend it. I would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana, but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of Charlie Wilson's War than with the ambiguities present in Syriana.",movie

So, stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky: Rebel Without A Pause, in a used video store, a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11, I decided to get it, just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person, pro or con, spoke of him. While glad I got the film, my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was, so what's all the fuss about?<br /><br />For a man with so many degrees, lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive', by the New York Times, according to the DVD's case, there sure was not a lot there, intellectually speaking. I know I would chew him up and spit him out in a debate, and I wouldn't even want to watch what a William F. Buckley could do to him. Granted, the whole film was seemingly about Chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere, and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say, rather than being on linguistics, so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly. But, again, if he is a linguist, and tops in his field, why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise?¬Ö. Even worse are his acolytes, who seem to further insulate the man from reality, by fostering delusions that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins. What little I knew of Chomsky before watching this film, this much I knew: he was generally considered a has been, and pretty much irrelevant intellectually, since the fall of the Soviet Empire. The film is so poorly structured, and without a narrative thread, that it's difficult to separate all of the jumble. His wife, Carol, as example, apparently gave one interview, which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film. She seems a nice enough woman, but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life. The lone interesting thing she says is that 9/11 was a great thing for the Chomskys, for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, this sort of film gives almost no biographical background. It's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears. Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one. Stylistically, there are no camera movements, no interesting edits, nor any signature touches, and most of the film is disjunct rambles by Chomsky, videotaped huzzahs of Chomsky declaiming on this or that, and slack-jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial, that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him. This is really poor film-making by director and editor Will Pascoe, who in the DVD's Filmmaker Statement, shows he's yet another uncritical acolyte of Chomsky's. Other than that, one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary, but mere agitprop, and a vanity piece of agitprop, at that, is that not a single time is Chomsky shown struggling with an answer. He seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds.<br /><br />Given that much of this dreck was filmed during Chomsky's lectures at McMaster University, in Ontario, Canada, prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, much of what Chomsky says seems as remote as things from the Vietnam War era. Yes, he makes some good points, here and there, on American media complicity before the war, but he follows them up with sheer lunacy, for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc, and not fully plotted out cabals. As example, he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace, but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled. Similarly, he claims Trilateralists run the world and that people's fear of crime is yet another cabal's result. Of course, that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers, and all that wasted time and money district attorneys' offices consume. He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades, when Castro and company were great sponsors of it, in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, until the Soviet Union fell. I can only guess that the UFO conspiracists are just waiting for Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species-mixing impregnation centers up in Idaho.<br /><br />In his simpleminded world without grays, Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco, whom he reviles, are; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals. In short, Chomsky is a man living in the past, in over his head on most issues, and out of his depth intellectually. Near this film's end he warns, 'Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice,' yet one can only laugh, as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like, no matter how barbarous their crimes, and anti-intellectual their posit. Please, pause before you waste your time and money on this silly, and already irrelevant, DVD.",movie

2454,"This is one of those books that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about. I have always been the kind of person that tries to prove statistics wrong, so as I read this book I was constantly thinking about just how accurate the statistics were.Each time I'd come across a new question, I'd turn to my husband and say ""Hey honey, which answer would you pick?"" And wouldn't you know, just about every time he would prove the statistic right. Ugh!Perhaps the thing that annoyed me most about this book is that the whole thing is based on the premise that there are certain things men just won't tell women. I found that when I asked the questions, he was totally willing to answer me openly and honestly. In fact, there was hardly ever a time that the question asked didn't spark lots of very interesting conversations. Things that had happened in our past, thoughts about our families growing up, things that had happened in the past week, and a few new revelations about how we interact with one another.It's laced with stereotypes and gender role expectations, and is not a book that I would recommend you reading in hopes of ""getting all the answers"" about the men in your life.

The Parathas were huge!  And fresh!  I think part of it had to do with the Doordash delivery person since he arrived fairly quickly, but it was still piping hot when I received them.

Also loved that this came with a fried egg so this was a massive chicken sandwich that requires 2 napkins. The spicy sauce was great and just the right level of heat for me.

My friend order the fries which was delicious. Thinking Church's chicken crinkle cut fries crispy and dusted with spices and drizzled with their sauce. I decided to have the Mac as a change of pace... I preferred the fries!

2469,"Disappointed. 

I really wanted this to be my new fave spot. my fianc√© was so excited about the crab roll, and it was so underwhelming that we didn't even finish it. we also got poutine with no bacon. i was not a fan. the crab - fishy. the fries - they were meh. had to throw out good portion of the fries. because they just weren't worth eating, if that makes sense. There were so many fries in my tall kitchen trash can that my 16 year old bichon frise could smell them and he's basically nose blind at this point. anyways he knocked over the trash and got into the fries and ate them all... so my dog did really like it.... he then got sick for days though. but to be fair he ate them out of the trash. so i can't really blame the fries.  anyways, i digress. 

So , rich paper fish is so close to my house... it's only a 25 minute walk. so, i wanted to give them another chance and try something else from the menu. i ordered the cod fish and chips because i thought that would be totally safe. fish and chips is my go to. i am what i like to call a pescatarian vegan... so often fish and chips is a perfect option for me if i want to be ""unhealthy"". today- i wanted just that- i wanted something fried. when i think fish and chips i thinj crispy beer battered goodness and thin crispy brit style ""chips"". what i got was huge potato sticks that were not crispy at all, and had no salt or flavor on them. and the fish was not bear battered! it was done in a similar way to fried chicken. i found this to be very strange and i found it to just totally miss the mark. for me, personally, i am throwing in the towel for this place and giving up trying because $50 dollars later, all i have is wasted food, and an annoyed look on my face.

2475,"haha! you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie. it like says something about myself i guess. the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test, or like some sort of drug, to take you to a place you have never been before. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus (sp?) he said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it, after you were done, it would take you to a new level, like a ladder, and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding. this movie is the same i think.<br /><br />As a movie it is without a doubt, the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way. first of all, this is snipes. i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies. and i have suffered through a few weak ones. however, although you know the movie might suck, you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was. which is the fun of it. i mean this is snipes. you know it might be good, but it will be alright, right? smile.<br /><br />so this thing on every level is pure boredom, pure unoriginality. the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious, yet so poorly done as to be comical. there is not one character in this movie that is interesting, in the least. and to make the whole thing more surreal, they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various Bourne identity type movies, only isn't quite right. in fact, although it seems close to action movie background music, it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantastically.<br /><br />then all the scenes in the total pitch black, where honestly since the characters are so flat, you don't really care whats going to happen, but regardless, after it happens and someone is killed, you just say to yourself, was i supposed to see that? what else? how about scenes with blinding, obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace, for a period of time that is too long to bear. sure let's throw that in. how bout this though. when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer, do some more of these in the dark kills where you really don't see what happened. and on top of that, lets face it you don't care. you were past bored way from the beginning.<br /><br />so i drifted in and out a couple times, but i caught almost all of this movie. and it becomes something you can watch, without something that engages your mind on any level, therefore, it becomes something you can effectively zone out with, and begin to think about your life, where its going, where its been, what we are as people.<br /><br />and that... that is the true magic of this film.",movie

2478,"After reading this book, I understand that there is much more to New Orleans' Mardi Gras than a drunken good time. Yet I am frustrated because Gill did little more than illuminate many promising lines of inquiry, without satisfying any of them.I concur with another reviewer (""Temerous erudition"") that Gill's organization is totally scattershot. He piles on the interesting tales, but without much of a conceptual scheme. Intriguing starts are made, then snapped off abruptly; and it's on to the next thought, like literary ADD. I knew I was not in the presence of a first-rate book when, in chapter 2, after introducing the Louisiana slave rebellion of 1811, Gill ends the one paragraph devoted to it thus:""Thus ended the largest slave uprising in the history of the United States; though a failure, it at least encouraged somewhat more liberal treatment of slaves as well as free people of color for most of the antebellum era.""And then we are off to a different subject. The reader is given a tantalizing view of a fascinating incident--the largest slave uprising in US history! But the parade needs to keep moving and the trail is lost in a blur. It feels like the sort of thing you'd hear from a New Orleans tour guide while walking through the French Quarter.Also, in this (as in many other instances), Gill does not substantiate his statements. What did the 'liberal treatment' consist of? Is the reader simply expected to look up the incident in an encyclopedia? If I had not read other sources, I would not know of the Louisiana ""Code Noir"" to which Gill is presumably referring. In a work purporting to be serious history, this is an abuse of the reader's time and money. (And when the sentence is deconstructed, does it really have any meaning? 'Somewhat more liberal' treatment for 'most' of the antebellum period? Without specific examples, this sentence simply ups the word count without saying much. It's the sort of thing my university professors would have torn apart with red pen. Ironic, then, that this is a university press book.)It's not utterly worthless, hence two stars instead of one. If you are a researcher looking to write a really definitive social and cultural history, this book is a decent place to start as a roadmap--if you fleshed out all of the false starts made by Gill, you'd have a really good book on your hands. Everyone else: caveat emptor!",book

We sat at the table awaiting our food and alas the ""not so good at his job"" food runner came and didn't even place our food on the table. He half way handed it in my boyfriends hand and walked off at the same time. Never knew that type of move was possible.

2483,"Spoiler warning!!!<br /><br />This is probably my least favourite Cary Grant film. I spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he persuades her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? I see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers/critics have taken. Finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book, than to change the ending - and this is a more unreasonable change of ending than, for example, in Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits are not mentioned) the book's ending is not definitely ruled out.<br /><br />In Robin Wood's Hitchcock's Films Revisited, he writes: ""As one mentally 'swiches' from ending to ending , the significance of every scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of the fiction's 'reality' disintegrates, the film becomes a 'modernist' text in which the process of narrative is foregrounded."" I enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else, but unless the film stands on a straightforward reading, then it fails. This one fails. Even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that recur in a few Hitchcock films.<br /><br />An annoying quibble. The year is 1941. Nothing in the film says that it is set in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Paris Bank, and goes there to do financial business? Does he not know that there is a war on? Indeed, were there still any flights from Croydon airport? Is he on good terms with the Nazis? How come it is never suggested that the Germans shot him as a spy or something.<br /><br />A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mystery writer, and her brother, the pathologist, there is a fifth person present, who is never explained nor introduced - a woman in a tuxedo. The credits say that she is Nondas Metcalf playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Is this not an example of how lesbians were coded in '40s films? Are we to take her as Isobel's lover? The books that discuss overt and hidden gays/lesbians in Hitchcock (e.g. Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.",movie

How humans may have worked long and diligently to make the sleds and boats to transport the stones, and how fanatical religious beliefs power this colossal task, is defined well by the authorThe storyline is well written, but lacks the depth of descriptions in regards to natural landscapes of the time and the dwellings in which families lived.

The focus is on what they thought and felt and how they lived.

2494,"The Secrets of Happily Married Men: Eight Ways to Win Your Wife's Heart Forever.I got this title from a wonderful woman I am in love with. She recently ended a long marriage that died for her long ago, despite effort and devotion on her part. I don't recall how she found this book, but for her it shed a lot of light on the basic nature of men and of women. I often hear a lot of blame among women, castigating, deriding, disrespecting and just despairaging talk about the men in their lives. There are some seriously flawed attitudes going down here. The same holds true with men, when they try to figure out what makes females tick. According to the author, a grave fault of marriage therapy is that they try to get men to feminize their psyche. We guys refer to this as handing your balls over to your wife. If that works, fine. This author does not recommend it as a way to happiness or a truly healthy marriage. Quite the opposite. Anyway, I'm reading it and find his insights really wonderful, especially considering the two horrible marriages I survived. Respect is the key, by both parties. Insight is required, and a total letting go of what we ""think"" the opposite sex should be like, and taking a much deeper look at the oddly different brains, phisiologies and psychies of the two ""gender races"" of humans. It goes a whole lot deeper than the simplistic themes John Grey made a career of by writing his Men From Mars books years ago. Anyway, this woman who offered me this title has has an ever greater degree of my undying love, devotion and respect. This book helped me to attain to that happy state. May we both live and love long and prosper.",book

2498,"I tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran, so I didn't know who had done it at first. The longer I saw it, the more I started thinking, ""Jesus, this looks like an Albert Pyun flick."" Wasn't quite sure, though, for two main reasons: the photography was quite good (and the Utah desert scenery was beautiful), and Scott Paulin gave an hilarious performance as Simon, a murderous cyborg, but with some style and a sense of humor. Paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liners he shot out, because Albert Pyun hasn't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career. Unfortunately, Paulin doesn't have all that much screen time before he's gone, and the movie's the worse for it. Lance Henriksen, playing the evil head cyborg, growls his way through his part, as he's done in countless other movies like this. I don't know what the hell Kris Kristofferson is doing in this thing; maybe he wanted to see what the Utah desert looked like and get paid for it. He goes through the movie looking (and sounding) like he just woke up, and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent. Kathy Long, the nominal hero, has a great body, is attractive, has a great body, fights extremely well, has a great body, and doesn't have an iota of acting talent, but that doesn't matter in a movie like this. This being an Albert Pyun film, it's full of the trademarks that we've all come to know and love: inane and idiotic dialog, choppy editing, and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured, ""Ah, nobody'll ever notice.""<br /><br />As bad as this movie is, however, it's a shade above most of Pyun's other efforts--this is ""Citizen Kane"" compared to his brain-numbing ""Adrenaline: Feel the Rush"", for example. The fights are pretty well done, if repetitive (after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other, you find yourself saying, ""Alright already, go to something else""), and Long is very athletic (and, as a previous poster has noted, has a great derri√®re). It's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as Pyun's usual extravaganzas. You could do worse than rent this movie--not much worse, granted, but worse nonetheless.",movie

2500,"This Italian semi-horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good, that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes. The only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film. The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon, go berserk and seemingly kill them. They show the nudity, but they never really show the murders at this point in the film. Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her. He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one, she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business. After a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes, foxes and such. At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely. This movie just did not work for me, it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where Evelyn did rise from the grave. Granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave, just not under her own power. The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too. I just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull.",movie

2507,"While reading The Water is Wide, I experienced exactly the kind of heart-warming, comical, enjoyable reaction Pat Conroy had in mind while writing the book. Several themes are apparent throughout, and it was easy for the reader to recognize the most important one. Pat Conroy taught his students and readers that no matter a person's race, literacy level, age, or gender, everyone matters, and everyone is equal.Pat Conroy moved many times as a child, since his father was in the military. His first job was teaching English in Beaufort, South Carolina. He then found himself teaching on the remote Daufuskie Island, which was referred to as Yamacraw Island in the novel. This teaching job provided the inspiration and plot for The Water is Wide.Pat Conroy, referred to as ""Conrack"" by some students, has an excellent way of teaching readers the importance of acceptance and equality. He does not preach or lecture his message, but his delivery of it through countless situations is just as effective. Sometimes his point is concealed by the amusement of the Yamacraw students, but by the end of each chapter, the reader will be reminded of the seriousness at hand.The Water is Wide never failed to entertain me. The book takes countless turns in the plot, and each turn results in comedy, sincerity, or amusement. The reader finds him or herself relating to each character, even though the lifestyle on Yamacraw Island is much different from most of the United States. Pat Conroy made me realize how lucky I am to live in a society where education is important and emphasized. This book opened my eyes to how people in other, less fortunate areas of the world live. I recognized that education is imperative, and how much the average student takes for granted.While Pat Conroy had no problems capturing my attention with plenty of interesting stories, he sometimes overwhelmed readers with his personality. Several parts of the book were filled with Conroy's strong opinion on characters and school rules. This sometimes interrupted the plot. Other than the occasional rant by Pat Conroy, the book flowed smoothly.The Water is Wide was an excellent read for teenagers and adults, especially those interested in teaching. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover, and it influenced me in ways only exceptional literature can.",book

2509,"I love the Internet. One can go back to the archives of any newspaper or magazine and read old book reviews and see if the comments have stood the test of time. In the case of Manchester's first 2 volumes on Churchill the critics weren't very nice. A 28 year old and new NYTimes critic Michiko Kakutani called volume one a bore that covered no new ground. She preferred Martin Gilbert's 4,000 pages leading up to 1939 to Manchester's 2,000 pages to mid 1940. Other critics think Manchester was superficial and found some of his superlatives to describe Churchill or generalizations about English society to be grating. Many of the most important comments remain so today; that Manchester did not seriously research and refute criticism of Churchill that was available to him.Gilbert has written over 80 books on a variety of topics. As Churchill's official biographer many have concluded that he tossed is objectivity out and became too much of a fan. Where Manchester's second volume stands up well is it's dramatic depiction of Churchill standing up to issues of German rearmament and English Appeasement policies of MacDonald, Baldwin and Chamberlain. He does an excellent job recounting history and believes he has uncovered countless facts that strung together nearly reflect a conspiracy by the English government to hide the build up. He offers comments and insights at every turn which are welcome as his point is to educate and influence. As in volume one he quotes from a very broad set of diaries and sources that enrich the experience and he introduces many of the essential players of that era in ways that go beyond the biography.There are serious problems however. Manchester really likes Churchill and as a result his failures are recounted but not condemned and often excused. He was in the same camp as the appeasers in seeing Communism as the main threat and as such he held Mussolini and Franco in high regard. As Exchequer he lead England back on to the gold standard in the 1920's which contributed to economic collapse in the 30's. And his actions in Norway are excused as being watered down by Chamberlain's other cabinet ministers rather than the disaster that it was. His disrespect of just about everyone is explained away rather than discussed as a possible reason for his estrangement.Manchester frequently says Chamberlain was against rearmament because it would hurt the economy but Manchester never explains well the condition of England at that time. Given Manchester's earnestness in placing us within English culture at the time sighting the major books, plays and music of the time it's a startling gap particularly given the frequency of comments on Chamberlain's motives.Overall we do get a very strong case for how appeasement went wrong. It's riveting and provocative. We also get a view on Churchill's home life where he struggled to stay out of debt and seemed to have weak relations with his family. Manchester is clear in his view that Churchill was a lone voice that spoke out frequently and courageously and he sees him as a brilliant multi tasker writing books and articles at a furious pace while keeping up with developments in Europe through his own intelligence network. Unfortunately it feels one sided which may unfairly undermine Manchester's credibility. Had he incorporated and discussed some of criticism of Churchill in more detail I think he would still have been successful in depicting Churchill as he saw him but giving the reader a more rounded view, warts and all.",book

2512,"This one is considered a key Pre-Code film ¬ñ from the director who later made the musical biopic THE JOLSON STORY (1946), but also the paranoid sci-fi INVASION U.S.A. (1952)! ¬ñ and features one of Barbara Stanwyck's best early roles.<br /><br />She's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day ¬ñ George Brent, Douglass Dumbrille, Edward van Sloan, Nat Pendleton and John Wayne (at one point addressing Stanwyck with the titular nickname, derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout) in the former category and, in the latter, Robert Barrat (as Stanwyck's father), Donald Cook (as her most tragic conquest), Alphonse Ethier (as her elderly mentor ¬ñ more on this later), Arthur Hohl (as a lecherous politician) and Henry Kolker (as Cook's boss and father-in-law, whom Stanwyck also seduces). Curiously, scenes in which Walter Brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors!<br /><br />Abetted by crackling i.e. typically hard-boiled dialogue and realistic Anton Grot sets, the narrative contains unexpected overtones of Nietzschean philosophy fed to our small-town heroine by the intellectual Ethier (Stanwyck complains to him early on that she's no ""ball of fire"" which, of course, contradicts her later comedy ¬ñ directed by Howard Hawks and co-starring Gary Cooper ¬ñ of that name!). Under Ethier's auspices, she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success; the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the New York firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one ¬ñ relating to an ambitious statesman's lust for power ¬ñ in Sergei Eisenstein's October (1927)! Sociologically, it's also interesting that Stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid/companion.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the film are simply terrific; at first, I found the latter stages somewhat disappointing ¬ñ because I was expecting to see Stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly-introduced George Brent character while he ignores her¬Öbut, just like the others, he's soon under her spell! On second viewing, however, this aspect felt less jarring ¬ñ as it's evident that Stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused, and that her tenure in Paris has softened her (even if she tries to cling to her hard-earned wealth for as long as it's possible).<br /><br />Released on DVD by Warners as part of their FORBIDDEN Hollywood VOLUME 1 COLLECTION, the film is presented in two strikingly different edits ¬ñ a recently unearthed Pre-Release version and the tamer Theatrical Release print. Among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to Stanwyck's life as a tramp from the age of 14 (though it's heard in the accompanying trailer!), while many other scenes have been shortened (i.e. censored for content): the violent fisticuff which develops between Stanwyck and Hohl after she resists his advances; the seduction at the railroad car; the scene in which Dumbrille is surprised with Stanwyck by Cook; the shooting, followed by a suicide (only shots are heard in the shorter version); Stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing (again, only Brent appears in the version released to theaters), etc. Tha latter, then, utilizes alternate takes for some scenes ¬ñ and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version; however, we also get an obviously tacked-on happy ending (the Pre-Release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open-ended note) and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by Ethier to Stanwyck in New York which, basically, has the function of substituting all references to Nietzsche!",movie

Come on, how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way!) I wonder if one guy on the credits = one drawing! The lines are rough, the 3d work inadequate (I'm not against it, but not in this film) But the backgrounds are corrects. The storyline is rather dumb, far from the precise cleverness of the BD, and obviously aimed at an international audience. To distribute a movie all over the world doesn't mean to take everyone in the world for a simple-minded guy... A cultural object is far more interesting when challenging, even when it is a foreign movie (being french in this case it's even worse!).<br /><br />Some new stuff is doing well (the Olaf character, sometimes, like with the stone explanation, but it's not great) but the modern references are exasperating (music, SMS -not even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird named short message service: does anyone know imagination?).

2524,"I have been, from about the age of ten, a voracious reader of man's highest aspirations for self-development. Considered precocious by teachers and peers alike, I was always searching for Truth outside the standard doctrines of religious and philosophical orthodoxy: if for no other reason that it appeared to me intuitive that the real answers to life's ultimate and most pressing questions could only be known by direct experience and not through external data...Dr. Bucke's magnum opus, COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, first came to my attention when I was 17 (1973). Immediately, I became aware that this was no ordinary work. First published in 1901, the beginning of the current century, it still stands today as one of the monumental achievements in the history of written thought. Not only were Bucke's theories original, the most poignant being that there is a scientific basis for an advanced state of consciousness in man -- a state wherein the new cosmically consciousness individual is as far above the average self-conscious homo sapien (you and I) as we are above lower animal life, but he magically tied together over two thousand years of religious, philosophical, and psychological thought in a massive intellectual suture of such compelling force that to this day there is no equal.Even the great psychologist, Williams James, was so impressed by Cosmic Consciousness, that he devoted an entire chapter in his own great work, THE VARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE, written some four years later, to examining Bucke's incredible findings.Today I am 41 years old. Since my initial discovery, I have managed to re-read Bucke's opus three times and have devoured several thousand more volumes concerning the subjects into which Bucke brought deep revelation, meaning, and an immeasureable, interdisciplinary vision and unity. I can say, without question, that no other written work I have encountered is comparable in historical importance in any of the hitherto referenced subjects.Bucke's work, though perhaps not recognized as such by the intelligensia, is every bit as monumental in the fields of metaphysics, philosophy, and psychology as Adam Smith's WEALTH OF NATIONS was to economics; the MAGNA CARTA was to political science; and the ORIGIN OF SPECIES was to biology -- no, more so -- because while these literary monuments are dated in their contribution, Bucke's work continues to inspire new readers with its affirmation of higher consciousness as no mere philosophical conjecture. You cannot finish reading Cosmic Consciousness without a clear vision that higher consciousness is not only inevitable for you, the individual, but is the eventual destiny of humans as a species.My last re-reading of COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS occurred last month. After all this time I remain in awe of its power, its sincerity, its clarity, its sincerity, but most important, its relevancy to my own development as a human being.Among all non-fictional works I have ever read, COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS stands alone. Very alone.Greg Catoncaton@ifu.netJuly 27, 1997",book

The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the ""action scenes"", the... ahhhh forget it. I can watch a piece of crap like ""The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z"" (aka ""Zaat"") over and over and over with hardly any ill effects (I like it in fact- btw, it will be on TCM later this month- October, 2009) but ""Hobgoblins"" is a whole 'nother ballgame.<br /><br />The worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz ""New Wave"" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room is STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD. This torment will last for days. <br /><br />Good luck, won't you?",movie

Although I've ordered maki several times before, I will now skip on doing so and just stick to the sashimi. I won't get into details; maybe it's just not up to my liking. One of my favorite menu items is the Seafood Udon soup. It's a must-try if you enjoy lemongrass and fish.

Meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons. The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer. This film is so full of filler I watched the DVD at x2 and read the subtitles, fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking (they walk everywhere) and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring, uneventful, low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits.

Everybody was walking around, but nobody was doing anything productive. The guy made half of my burrito, then he went off to do something else. Five minutes later, somebody else comes along to finish my burrito. Finally, my burrito sits there for another five minutes before a cashier comes back, which happens to be the first guy who started my burrito. He asks which one is mine and if I want anything else. I said I want a Fiji water and some chips and salsa. He charges me for the burrito and chips, but forgets about the water. After he hands me everything, I told him he forgot the water.

An avid reader and Jewish community professional, I'm always wanting to find ways to understand Jewish history and culture in deeper ways.Barely made it through this thinly disguised catalog of family situations that, admittedly, reflects a lot of significant research by the author. We hear about betrothal, marriage, childbirth, miscarriage, death in childbirth, a breach birth, impotence, circumcision, death, mourning etc etc. Plus a lot of material about relations between Christians and Jews and between popes and royalty / nobility. And of course, a vast amount of Talmud, herbalism, and wine-making lore being shown off. Most not very enlightening or well integrated.If the prose were more compelling, the pacing more exciting, we could have a novel here... but instead it's a mishmash of uninspired ideas, not a pleasant turn of phrase, a thought-provoking metaphor, or a fascinating character in view.Who might like this book? The Sisterhood reading club of an orthodox synagogue, one that secretly wants to read bad-porn-quality descriptions of sexual intercourse? A re-enactors club about to branch out into early medieval herbal cures?But I did like the scene where they ""invented"" champagne.

2541,"Having read most of the comments I feel like I have a word to say as well.<br /><br />What bothers me most is that most people here are think that this movie is either pro or con to the subject of death penalty and whether it worked with them. I remember having read an article back in 1995 when the film was published (yes, it has interested me so much ever since I heard that it would come out that I have not forgotten about the articles I read back then) in which Tim Robbins said that he did not want to make a movie to convince audiences of neither one nor the other.<br /><br />And I think that is completely right. I have to admit that I believe that in the way he made this film he did tend a little bit to the anti-death-penalty-side, but nevertheless people are still allowed to make their own choice. And this is a very rare thing in American films.<br /><br />I have shown this movie to many people since it came out and I have seen all kinds of reactions. Death-penalty-supporters became opponents or became even stronger in their belief. And many death-penalty-opponents (including me) grew stronger in their belief that death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world. But I have even seen opponents turn into supporters. This and the fact that people here seem to fight about it shows to me that there are really many ways of looking at it. So whatever effect it has on you, the important thing is that it makes you THINK.<br /><br />This is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice, that does not shy away with a simple path by making the convicted either bad or innocent. This may be a tough thing for people who prefer being entertained or tought a lesson. There is no lesson here you need to find one yourself.<br /><br />Everyone praises the acting, directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the I will not repeat it all again.<br /><br />So if you have not seen this yet, do so - if you dare to be challenged!",movie

2543,"I managed to catch a late night double feature last night of ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) and ""Before Sunset"" (2004), and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately. After sleeping it over, I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter, and I shall explain why.<br /><br />Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), only 25 at the time of the film's release; and Julie Delpy (the Three Colors trilogy), then 26 (although looking much younger). He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris. They meet on the Budapest-Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.<br /><br />The film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future. The characters of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (Celine's accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half American-half French, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the character's credibility), were a mirror of the time. Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clich√©d and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me. The fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.<br /><br />All in all, Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.",movie

After some debate as to whether they were still participating in the Magical Dining promotion, they finally decided they would. Service was split between two waiters and multiple servers, several times servers coming to our table offering us things we did not order.

The food quality was more what I would expect at a bar. The Cajun Chicken Rolls were nicely spiced but dried out from over frying. The Halloumi, Panzanella & Roasted Brussel Sprouts were very good. The slider and shrimp lettuce wraps left much room for improvement.

The Chocolate Dipped Cheesecake Lollipops tasted store bought.

I will qualify this review by stating these were items from the promotional menu, which even now I can see they have upgraded with new offerings like Tiki Masala and Smoked Thai Spare Ribs and they have removed the items I liked least. Also, their happy hour pricing is a great deal.

2557,"Yes, definitely better than my viewing of Death Tunnel. Actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent. It was kind of like Wrong Turn meets the Hills Have Eyes.<br /><br />BUT: 1.) When the ""kids"" (high school or college?) are discussing horror movies in the kitchen, everything Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream (1996). The thing about the big-breasted girls etc.<br /><br />2.) Was Steve NOT a bootleg Randy from Scream? 3.) Besides the fact that it took place in October, what the hell did the movie have to do with Samhain? Pretty unnecessary if you ask me. I find it humorous when I see those horror movies from the 80's that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram.<br /><br />4.) Wow they made a Sam Raimi reference!!! 5.) Why was Gary and his sister in the movie? They're characters had nothing to do with anything. And hes so psychic that he couldn't even see his OWN death? 6.) When Gary was being killed in the bathroom (at that point, the deaths became simply Troma-licious) how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs but not hear them when she was standing outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis- thats primarily a Scottish dish, not Irish.<br /><br />8.) So the lesson is if you ARE like Shae and don't have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film, you'll be the one to live? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like walking dishes of Chili con carne.<br /><br />10.) When they brought in Gary's sister, did they forget that Steve HAD been strapped there and wonder where he went? 11.) Was there not more than one killer? Shae beat that one, but never encountered any more of them.<br /><br />12.) What was with the flashbacks to those other people? Half of them Shae didn't know if they were dead or alive, so what was with that? 13.) Why didn't they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why did no one ever call the police? And apparently everybody KNEW those people lived in the woods, why did they never organize some kind of raid? 15.)As far as I know, they were not zombies OR vampires- so how could she ""turn into"" one at the end?

2559,"I was blown away by the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. A hardened sci-fi fan, I like to think I can pick out the good stuff from the BS, and this was good stuff.<br /><br />As such, when I first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago I got a sick feeling in my gut. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be reused in Caprica, which wouldn't work at all. BSG's story, of a mournful ragged band of survivors, trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors.<br /><br />Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays that civilization in it's cold and decadent heyday. The overall vibe I got from Caprica was similar to that of Minority Report, minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In true BSG form, Caprica has in it's first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom, racism, the morality of playing God and the nature of the human soul.<br /><br />The casting for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and deep, from the obsessive and distant scientist-turned-entrepreneur, to his troubled and willful daughter, each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles.<br /><br />Music, which was used so powerfully in BSG, also plays a significant role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show it's own feeling quite distinct from either of it's predecessors. <br /><br />The new Caprica is definitely it's own show, pulling from the Battlestar franchise only as much as it needs. I look forward to the full series.",movie

2561,"I was interested in reading this novel after seeing the Paul Newman-Joanne Woodward movie on American Movie Classics one evening. To my surprise and great pleasure, the book is far better than the movie -- although it doesn't hurt one's appreciation of the characters to imagine those two talented movie stars speaking their dialogue. At nearly 1000 pages in length, the book requires a major commitment on the part of the reader, but O'Hara never disappoints. His story moves along at just the right pace, and the growth -- or lack thereof -- of his characters is a revelation. I particularly recommend this work to anyone who seriously wants to write a historical novel, because its structure and style are very instructive of how to work in the genre to maximum effect. This book introduced me to a writer whose work is no longer very accessible, either in libraries or on web sites such as these -- and more's the pity for it. What appeared to be a dry, overwritten potboiler of no special distinction turned out to be an engrossing story of one man's desperate search for the love that had always eluded him. I recommend this novel enthusiastically to anyone who finds contemporary popular fiction dissatisfying. And for the average reader, the best part of finishing this book is the knowledge that there's more of John O'Hara's work yet to be discovered.",book

The Zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept--a blind guy is the greatest swordsman in Japan and spends each movie righting wrongs and exacting retribution on evil doers. He's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and addictive (I've actually seen every movie). It is because of this I saw this final installment of the Hanzo the Razor series, as I assumed it would be very similar....and boy was I wrong! It turns out that the Hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of ""women who deserve it"". You see, Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and interrogates them by violently raping them with his ""penis of steel"". How he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is NOT for the squeamish.<br /><br />Overall, I just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films. However, from looking at the other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular...and that is pretty scary. Despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes, the films just are like brain pollution--and I'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women.",movie

2572,"One of the best musicals ever made, this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent, rather than for what people might expect. The lighting and set are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (this has a special name that I cannot think of). The dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used. The movie is well paced, beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish. A real joy is the MUSIC. Such an array of first-rate songs, from beginning to end, that are perfectly performed and orchestrated. Also, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, that might have only two or three. Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie. Another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it.",movie
2573,"This movie was a heart-felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood, and the little things that shaped who Tom Hank's was. Using a very cryptic story, they were able to give you an idea of what truly happened to Tom Hank's character as a child. And while scenes like the flying machine may have never happened, it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth. In all good conscience, I could not rate this lower then a 9 out of 10, great performances from all the actors, and while many may not have understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is murdered by his step father, and Tom Hanks covers it up using a far-fetched story about a flying machine, pay close attention to the little details, such as the turtle that he still has, even though his brother ""flew"" off with it. Truly, a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves recognition for it.",movie
2574,"This movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. There are only three locations (the school, the store, and the coach's house) that are really used. It's primarily at the coach's house, however. A movie doesn't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.<br /><br />Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up. One is rich, important, and has no real love outside of money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition is turning him sour. One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. One is a traveling alcoholic.<br /><br />First off, I love the actors in this film. They've all been household names to me. They proved their worth here.<br /><br />One of the most pivotal moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up on the coach. He yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game. His blows the coach's whistle and yells back his catchphrases - ""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned!"" It's amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn't need shiny effects to interest them.",movie

While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf...",book
2579,"It's hard to think of a literary work that has been filmed and staged in more imaginative variations than Charles Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;--there's the excellent George C. Scott version, the delightful Muppet version, the charming Mr. Magoo version, etc., etc. But ultimately true &quot;Carol&quot; lovers should go back to Dickens' original text, which remains a great read.&quot;Carol&quot; tells the story of cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge, who despises the Christmas holiday and scorns all who celebrate it. But a visit from a series of supernatural beings forces him to reevaluate his attitude--and his life.With this simple plot Dickens has created one of the enduring triumphs of world literature. It's a robust mix of humor, horror, and (most of all) hope, all leavened with a healthy dash of progressive social criticism. One thing I love about this book is that while it has a focus on a Christian holiday, Dickens puts forth a message that is truly universal; I can imagine this story resonating with people of any religious background, and also with more secular-oriented people.This is a tale of greed, selfishness, regret, redemption, family, and community, and is enlivened by some of the most memorable characters ever created for English literature. Even if Dickens had never written another word, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; would still have, I believe, secured his place as one of the great figures of world literature.",book

2586,"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split"". There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream. Similar to ""They Live"", ""1984"" and ""The Matrix"", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy Big Brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city. This is all revealed pretty early on in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality. Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. I challenge anyone to not be rewinding, memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.",movie
2587,"It's somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on IMDb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire IMDb career and yes you've guessed it, that film is ""Parasomnia"". I've often suspected suspiciously good reviews on IMDb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing , but it seems fairly transparent in this case.<br /><br />That's not to say Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has a great baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil, I could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better. The actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too.<br /><br />Although I understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it's the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that. If you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly, then the story is losing you and that's what kept happening to me with this film. Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but I will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing, not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life.<br /><br />All in all, there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism, but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special.",movie

2590,"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to ""cure"" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy.",book

2596,"This was the first study Bible I received as a young Christian...and man, if Dake said it, it had to be true. When I became ""aware,"" as I like to put it, of Dake's fallibility, I suddenly became imbued with a desire to check all my sources. And now, many years later, the continuing longevity of the Dake Bible has been nothing but astounding to me. (For those interested, Leon Bible has produced a little booklet called Finis J. Dake's Annotated Bibliography: The Sources Used in His Collective Writings. The only word I can use to describe a good portion of his sources is ANTIQUATED.)Granted, the man had a gift if we can believe some of the stories written about him. It has been said that Dake could quote the entire NT verbatim, even giving appropriate verses and chapter changes (Lester Sumrall, Pioneers of the Faith, pg. 71). However, there is something terribly amiss in much of Dake's theology. An example is in order.Concerning the ""kenosis,"" particularly with regard to what it was that Christ ""emptied"" himself of, Dake writes that ""It could not have been His divine nature, for He was God...from all eternity"" (pg. 218). However, it is impossible to ascertain exactly what Dake believed constituted the divine nature because he follows his statement that Christ did empty himself of ""His divine attributes and outward powers that He had with the Father from eternity. He had no power to do miracles until He received the Holy Spirit in all fullness"" (218). While Dake's first statement appears to be an improvement on the Christology of other adherents from the 19th-century-movement called Kenoticism (which held that what Christ emptied himself of was, in fact, ""the form of God,"" or his deity [Erickson, Christian Theology, 2nd ed., pg. 749]), the blatant contradiction that ""He could do nothing of Himself in all His earthly life"" (Dake, pg. 218) makes it clear that Dake was more than a little misguided in his Christology.One thing that can be said about Dake's magnum opus is that it is ambitious--hence the reason for the extra 1/2 star--an E for effort, if you will. Nevertheless, the Bible is too dated (especially with regard to archaeological and historical data) and, quite honestly, too fraught with theological errors (the most notable complaint among reviewers) to be considered a study Bible of any valid worth.",book

2599,"Martin Lawrence could be considered a talented man, but those days are long gone. Runteldat shows a man who at once tries to play the sympathy card to his plight yet takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks it'll benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this point in his life, his best days were behind him: his half-funny show was dead in the water after his co-star left and to today he faces a career of voice acting and god awful action films.<br /><br />One gets the impression that this concert film wasn't made to give Lawrence's career another boost after his humiliation but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by both trying to pathetically salvage what remained of his life and somehow twist it into something to be proud of, some defining moment in which he showed himself to have 'earned' his fame. Sadly, the concert is nothing but a gravelly-voiced Martin incoherently trying to be funny, invoke pathos, and then claim he doesn't care about it at all because hardcore. The sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for Lawrence: the way he rambles on invoking sad pity laughter makes you wish that he would just strip down to his underwear on stage, wave a gun around, and just reenact it all over again. There is no real insight to his performance at all. Much like the childish title states, Martin is trying to make his ultimate moment of truth his own in his way and fails miserably. He would have been better off waiting for the E! True Hollywood Story instead of running on a stage and making an idiot out of himself for the second time.<br /><br />Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film--or rather, career eulogy--is that Martin didn't put any thought into this. What was this film supposed to prove? Sadly, that his fame was fleeting, he was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident, and now that the only way he can get work is piggybacking Will Smith or a Pixar production. They might as well called this concert 'Tombstone' because that's what it is. Martin Lawrence just dies on stage here, and with it goes what could have been an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic side note in history.",movie
2600,"I have read William Golding's book Lord of the Flies. The book is about a group of boys who try to survive on a isolated island after a plane-crash. It is interesting so see the relationships between the boys, how they immediately take up different positions. At their fist meeting one boy, Jack, is chosen as the leader. Rules are made and accepted by every one. In the beginning everything was organized. Young and old boys are working together and everything is fine. But then their friendship begins to fail. One boy who they call Piggy becomes the outsider. Another boy who's name is Jack, who from the beginning also wanted to be the leader, starts to take over more and more. One day the group splits up and Jack forms his own group with completely different rules. Nothing is working on the island anymore and it runs out of control. One night something terrible happens, and it's then when Ralph understands that it's only the beginning. The rules which they all decided from the beginning don't exist any longer. Then Ralph becomes alone, against everyone else...I thought the book was kind of good, but not as good as I had expected it to be, because it's so popular. It is written with describing sentences that makes it easy to imagine the environment and how they think. The language is easy to understand, since the author writes as the children think. But yet the text is deep and the book made me think. The subject that Golding has chosen is unusual, but good. It doesn't only tell us about the boys on the island, but wants to show that power isn't only a positive thing and can lead to something else, much worse.From Karin, 15 years",book

In these unique travel times there is definite decrease in number of customers, but I was extremely surprised how few were here for food/beverage.

The person who initially attempted to input the order (I had a coupon, and the system doesn't allow for that on the self-help screen) didn't know how to handle that, so he had to find someone else. #2 had some challenge as well.

2605,"This movie is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the stunning photography and acting, the kolossal-like scenes of battles (no computer graphics here, just thousands of people). Someone said the story has something to do with the Sheakespearian tragedies. I find some connections with the Greek tragedy tradition, too.<br /><br />The emperor, extraordinarily acted, struggles between power and love, but he is forced (for the greater good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose the power (and the loneliness, the hate of his subjects and kins) as his destiny. He, like Creon in Antigone, was a good guy before becoming emperor. Once gained power, he has to be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. Entrapped by power he becomes a monster. Overall, The Qin emperor is a majestic Greek tragedy figure.<br /><br />The assassin evolves towards a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics. This character is really unforgettable, too.<br /><br />Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is the uncorrupted morality, nor by power or love or hate. She is morality against power, somehow like Antigone. Her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) have always a moral rationale.<br /><br />In conclusion, a wonderful movie.

2612,"McConaughey in a horror/thriller? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The plot is told in flashback mode, and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament. I can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you'll be, in the very least, surprised.<br /><br />All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job directing those kids, and his acting is awesome. McConaughey's acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />This movie challenges you to think. Is Dad crazy? Is there a God? Do Demons exist? How far would you go to right a wrong. And what is ""right"" anyway? I'm still thinking.<br /><br />And thus I recommend ""Frailty"". 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second, or even third viewing.",movie
2613,"I jotted down a few notes here on THE FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell-fest ...<br /><br />1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison. I only hope that he can find Armani prison wear to go off in style with: One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in $4500 designer overcoats, a $7300 designer silk suit, and seeing his $3500/month Los Angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh.<br /><br />2) Leading lady Tracey Phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed, and amazing breasts that are hi-lighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to Satan. At least back in the 1970's our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them, though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination. By the final 10 minutes of the movie all I could think about is what her breasts probably would look like.<br /><br />3) Professional Psychics living in Los Angeles can afford $4 million dollar condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a view that would make Brad Pitt decide that he was roughing it. As a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND DR., which at least had the good sense to make it's condo resident a successful movie director. The only Professional Psychics I have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud.<br /><br />4) I forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful, and his ""How's it going', Buddy Boy?"" line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since ""THANKS FOR THE RIDE, LADY!!"" from CREEPSHOW 2.<br /><br />5) Underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit Zippo lighter into them, which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous. And since Zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing, the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your $7300 Gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous.<br /><br />6) The stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least, and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal BOMB ratings from critics when released.<br /><br />7) Movie satanists always amaze me: Here is a guy who has tapped into some Luciferian bid for power, and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him, he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people's apartments. Speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible, can fly, and is able to put his being inside of other people's bodies -- and yet he obliges star Lou Diamond Phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film's conclusion, yet does not have the good sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to ensure that he wins.<br /><br />And on and on ... To be watched in the company of wise-cracking friends while consuming beer. You'll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously.<br /><br />4/10",movie

2618,"Most people have now seen Starship Troopers, the movie, filled with tongue in cheek action scenes, charting the rise of Jonnie Rico through the ranks of the Mobile Infantry.The book is so much more. It is strong on the military sci-fi elements, and gives a great run through boot camp and subsequent training. The description of the first drop on the Skinnies world is excellent, filled with well thought out technology and tactics.But throughout the book Heinlein uses his story to question our assumptions about the way we look at politics, universal sufferage, corporal punishment etc. For instance, he points out that you cannot possibly have such a thing as a &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot; since delinquency requires a sense of duty, and the thing that divides juveniles from adults is the appreciation of duty. You can only be a delinquent once you accept your duty as an adult, and then fail to perform it.The society on earth, ruled by &quot;Citizens&quot; who have the power to vote because they have demonstrated a concern for mankind above concern for the self is an interesting one. It smacks a bit of military dictatorship, except of course, the veterans can't vote while in uniform. The need to &quot;Earn&quot; the right to vote is not a bad concept.Probably the most contraversial propositon is the use of corporal punishment to &quot;Train&quot; children and to punish adults. Heinlein becomes totally simplistic when he likens the training of children to that of puppies, but even here he makes us question current structures that are clearly not working.This was much more than the Military Sci-Fi novel that I was expecting. It turned out to be a really good read, well worth a look.",book

2620,"I count some of Susan Wiggs' novels among my favorites, such as ""Passing Through Paradise,"" and, most especially, ""The Lightkeeper,"" but I found myself mildly bored with this one. It began interestingly enough; Hunter, an embittered widower, seeks out a reclusive horsemaster to tame his crazed prize horse. Turns out, the horsemaster is dead, but his daughter, Eliza, claims to possess her father's skill and persuades Hunter to stay while she tames the horse.Eliza is charming; a sheltered girl alone on a small island with a gift of healing. Hunter is a tortured alcoholic unable to connect with his children after the tragic death of their mother, and struggling to make a formerly successful tobacco farm into a sort of racehorse ranch.Sparks fly between Hunter and Eliza near the beginning of the book, culminating in their making love on the island, but when Hunter persuades Eliza to return home with him to become governess to his troubled children, the story changes focus towards the children, Eliza, and horses, and Hunter strives, (rather too successfully), to keep Eliza at arm's length, certain of her unsuitability as a wife to him, though he apparently has feelings for her (which I found somewhat difficult to discern). Throughout the book, however, there are several references to his flouting the common convention of post-Civil-War southern plantation life, to the shock of friends and neighbors, so I found myself wondering why he'd give a fig what they would think were he to marry Eliza.The characters of the two wisened, elderly black women who chose to stay on with Hunter's family, even after he freed all of his father's slaves, were scarcely ever mentioned after the first several pages of the book.Worth a read, but not my favorite from this talented author.",book

The performance of the female lead is admirable; her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to David's sophisticated role was very charming.

2625,"Riccardo Freda may have a good reputation; but since we now that many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great Mario Bava; it's clear that he wasn't one of Italy's most gifted filmmakers back in the seventies. This film pretty much proves that as despite the simplistic plot; it's a sprawling mess and overall, I'd even have to go as far as to say that Tragic Ceremony is WORSE than Freda's insipid Giallo effort, The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire. Freda apparently disowned this movie, and I certainly don't blame him! The plot simply follows a bunch of kids that run out of petrol in the middle of nowhere. They happen upon a house while searching for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice, as the owner is just about to conduct a satanic ceremony...ho hum. The film features a lead role for Camille Keaton, who would go on to star in the exploitation classic I Spit on Your Grave some years later, but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talentless performers. The film features one decent gore scene towards the end, but this really isn't enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there. I have a high tolerance for rubbish Italian films that don't make sense - but even I couldn't stand this one. Miss it, miss nothing!",movie

2627,"This book continues the excellent series of John Carter/Barsoom. We are now introduced to the daughter of Dejah Thoris and John Carter. Second in beauty only to her mother.

I really enjoy the way the story unfolds, and the descriptions used throughout the series. I read a lot of books. I will cherish my opportunity to read these books again and again. I do not tire of the constant change in scenery and characters as described by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Since each book has introduced new species, as well as new areas of Barsoom, I find each book to be a new adventure.I find these books to be highly entertaining.

The illustrations, admittedly the author's strong suit, were strong indeed. The images were of such excellent quality that they almost made the book worthwhile. The beginning of the story held promise, but ended up spending beyond its means into imagination. Either a story of the boy visiting his grandmother for the summer and experiencing adventure on the river, or an imaginary tale of prolific so-close-you-could-touch-it wildlife would have been good. Neither was completed, and the resulting combination left me feeling flat. The experts, my two and five year-old grandchildren lost interest before the book was halfway through.

2631,"Back in August, '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies, big hits like ""Urban Cowboy"", ""Every Which Way But Loose"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" were all the rage. For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office receipts by drawing in that same ""Urban Cowboy"" crowd. Instead ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title. Thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it's time. No matter what, probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy it.<br /><br />Its too bad this movie bombed. But I think it would have anyway even if it hadn't been saddled with a poor title. Its a movie ahead of its time. One could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or *great-uncle anyway) to the kinds of comedy made today. For its day ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didn't get popular in comedy till much later on. While clearly its a child of ""Airplane"", its more mature, and while its certainly no ""Knocked Up"" it clearly points in that direction. The characters are more ""comedy-mature"" in that they are low-key and don't ever think anything they do is anything other than serious. The jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situations.<br /><br />But, more than that, ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" is a real time capsule. A great look back at the exceedingly early 80's. The people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around them.<br /><br />I don't know if my review is helping you, but this is really a good, sometimes kind of excellent, movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was just about to become the toast of Hollywood as her next movie after this one was ""Tootsie"" which finally made her a star. Howard Hessmann was arguably the biggest ""current"" star of the the day when this movie was made. Back in 1981 Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show ""WKRP in Cinncinatti"". He played its lead character, the rascally night DJ. Daniel Stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown-up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80's sitcom ""The Wonder Years"" There are also several faces that are no longer with us these days, its nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as a an old married couple on a journey. Jessica Tandy would finally pick up her Oscar ten years after this for ""Driving Miss Daisy"". There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her final movie appearances. Though she'd had a brilliant career she didn't get her Oscar till four years after this in 1985's ""Trip to Bountiful"", for which she richly deserved it, and she died very soon after getting that award.<br /><br />Plus, there are lots of other faces in this movie, actors who aren't big stars but who have done tons of supporting work. Many are familiar even if you can't think of their name.<br /><br />This movie is a pleasant little diversion. A bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all, in a vaguely Altman-esk way, end up heading towards Florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of Ticlaw, Florida, which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to Ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the map.<br /><br />And thats also what this movie is about, fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system, which had only recently been ""completed"". It had taken a generation to build, from when it was authorized by congress around 1960, through many years as different parts were built and then ""went live"" and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is. And people were enchanted by it. Everybody by 1980 was pretty much an ""interstate freeway veteran"" in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs, only on and off ramps, and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible. By 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom. And this was all new then. <br /><br />The ending is anti-climatic and isn't that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment. What makes it great is it's the journey not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day. Forget its title; instead let it take you down memory lane.",movie

2646,"First of all I should preface this by saying this was the first Stephen King book I have ever read, and how I got to it is a story within itself. I am a high school history teacher, and one day back in November I was waiting on my students to gather their things, to leave our school's library. As I was waiting I noticed the book and picked it up to read the back cover. Needless to say I found a picture of the author instead. As I waited I started to read throught King's intro to the book, and became increasingly interested in what was inside. For whatever reason I had carried the book out of the library with me and at the end of the day, seeing it on my desk I started to read.Needless to say I was hooked instantly. For years I had heard how long winded King's novels were and this is what had kept me away from his works, and as I discovered he is long winded and wordy, but that isn't a bad thing.So my review, easily the first 400 or so pages of the book is some of the finest writing I have ever read. His attention to detail and the way King sets us up by describing the carnage caused by the ""super flu"" is second to none. In describing the decimation of the United States, King is all the while introducing us to characters, that while we don't know it early in the book, the reader will come to feel attached too.Unfortunately after such a rousing start, I felt that for the next 300 pages the slowed down considerably, to the point where it became a struggle plow through the book. Where as the begining book was long winded and painted an epic picture, the long windedness of the middle 300 pages, seemed to drag. While I knew Mother Abigail to be a critical character, I felt no connection to her, and really could have cared less about her history.Finally around page 700, the book kicks back into high gear as King starts to set us up for the final battle between good and evil. The problem with this is that King does such a good job setting up the battle, that the author just can't deliver on the suspense that he has built. Ultimately I was let down, by the climax, feeling as if, the ultimate battle between good and evil, went out with a wimper instead of a bang.After being letdown by the battle, the book lost my interest in the final 70 pages, as I was still feeling the disappointment of the battle between good and evil. Overall, it was a good read and I would be interested to see King revisit these characters, since he left it wide open for a sequel. However, the ending didn't live up to the greatness of the beginning.",book

While the movie is certainly a chick flick, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 Red Sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans that were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious! A must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse, date, or significant other...especially if you are a baseball fan...and even more especially if you are Red Sox fan!!!",movie

2652,"From the start, you know this is a Sam Sherman film more than an Al Adamson film because as the credits roll, ""A Sam Sherman Production"" appears in letters as big as the title credit. Not only that, Mr. Sherman co-wrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use Bob Livingstone, a washed-up, 69 year old Western star of the old Hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that Sherman thought would capitalize on the recent success of ""Swinging Stewardesses"". <br /><br />Now why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a soft-core exploitation feature? It defies explanation, but that is Sam Sherman for you. His obsession with old Hollywood colored a lot of his films for Independent International Pictures, and he and Al Adamson frequently tried to get has-been actors for their films (e.g. J. Carrol Naish, Russ Tamblyn, Lon Chaney Jr.,etc.). But Bob Livingstone? Tell me the drive-in demographic knew who this '40's second-rater was; it's ridiculous! <br /><br />But then again, ""Naughty Stewardesses"" was a successful picture for them, so we can't just write this off as a Sherman fiasco. Still, by any aesthetic standard, it's an incoherent mess. Al Adamson wanted out of this picture, and it is easy to see why. First off, it has no genre focus at all and drifts around from super soft core (tits and ass/simulated sex only) to a kidnapping thriller (shades of Steckler's ""Rat Pfink and Boo Boo""!) In between, we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the stewardesses traipsing around Vegas to the hackneyed music of Sparrow, or Richard Smedley and Connie Hoffmann on a photo shoot in San Francisco. Worst of all, we get Bob Livingstone as a Jack LaLanne wannabe in a blue jumpsuit trying to be sexy...gag! (Thankfully, his big sex scene with Connie Hoffmann was deleted, but you can catch him slurping on her titties on the DVD in the Special Features section. Creepy.) <br /><br />This is a terrible, terrible movie, but I'll give it three stars for Gary Graver's photography and out of sympathy to Connie Hoffmann for having to make it with ""Wrinkles"" Livingstone. ""Naughty Stewardesses"" is for Al Adamson completists and/or scholars of exploitation film as Sam Sherman's commentary offers vital inside info. All others, BEWARE.",movie

The little nuances in their performances, the ""real"" dialogue and/or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing. The (time) structure of the movie, that keeps your toes the whole time, blending time-lines so seamlessly, that the editing seems natural/flawless.

2657,"Why did I have to go out and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN??? Maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement? But I'm guessing it's because I kind of enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a silly but funny horror-comedy which had some okay effects by Screaming Mad George. That and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). So I thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so dead wrong! <br /><br />Let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. I mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? As much as I love the premise, I really hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. It has this way too slick shot-on-video look. The lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). The acting... well don't even go there. The dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that Jamaican man was just moronic, saying ""man"" after every sentence). And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all I could think of was a seventh-rate Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.<br /><br />The best joke was were one guy asks ""Why are you talking to your watch?"". And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). Oh, yeah, and that little scene over the end-credits with those two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? There were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. A lot of people were killed off in original ways here, but all off-screen. Like I've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion, a crushed body, eyes being poked out, tongue ripped out,... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. That frontal shot of that British guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the DVD) wasn't even in the movie. I only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning I didn't see sh!t!). I was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen, and then I get to see nothing?!?! What a let-down! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie? That would be a shame, 'cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. Seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. Speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. They made MUNCHIES look like state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. But I guess that was the whole point of it. At some point, the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad CGI. Boy, you really have to see it to believe it. Best is to not see it, actually, 'cause this flick is just too bad (okay, I did laugh with it, for it kept getting worse and worse). Just stick with the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be okay (just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in it's own right).<br /><br />It's funny, but writer/director Michael Cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after JACK FROST 2, and then focused on writing. Turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So the man seems to have some talent after all.<br /><br />Now it would be far too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest rating possible. So I say one point for that naked Asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. Way to go Mr. Cooney!",movie

I saw this and, since I'm a fan of violence and gore, I got it. It got the rating of EM which means: Extremely Mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else, I got it. The warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge, and Nudity. The ""extreme violence"" struck my fancy. The movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick. It had one or two gory scenes but I've seen worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course the amount of gore in a movie isn't all that counts, right? You have plot also. Well, the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it. Don't rent it. I speak the truth.

""Attack of the Show"" is the replacement for the Screen Savers, with 3 co-hosts in the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran came to be something of a co-host as well, but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host, but that didn't pan out for some reason.<br /><br />Eventually (I just learned this from this very IMDb messageboard) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because (hey, this is what I read) the two got married. That was a big secret to me! Now there is a new female co-host, the not-as-hot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. She's hiding something in those tops she wears, while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it.<br /><br />AHEM! Sorry.<br /><br />""Attack of the Show"" deals with everything young people want to know about. It's music, movies, comic books, the internet and television. This is what's great about the show. If you don't want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching MTV, you can get all you want on AOTS. Some segments and bits they do are funny. They have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry, as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names.<br /><br />Even though the hosts aren't as geek as I'd like them to be, I still have found ""Attack of the Show"" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup.",movie
2671,"The boathouse disappointed last night.

My boyfriend and I decided to come here for a date night since we wanted to catch the Christmas Tree Trail before it closes on January 5th. 

After reading multiple reviews that raved about this place we decided to try it. 

We managed to get a reservation around 7:00. Even though the restaurant was extremely busy we were greeted pleasantly by the hostess and seated right away. After we were seated we were greeted by two servers that stated our designated server was busy at the moment but they would help get us started. We ordered our drinks, a vodka tonic for myself and a miller lite for my boyfriend, and were given fresh bread. 

A side note- they do not have any beers on draft here so keep in mind all beers will come in a bottle or can. 

The bread was warm, drizzled with honey and was delicious. Unfortunately, this is where my praises end. 

We placed orders for the hoisin chili calamari ($18.00) and a half dozen oysters ($22.00) for appetizers. 

After we placed appetizer orders our designated server greeted us and apologized for not being present earlier. He also explained the kitchen was running slightly behind so we may be waiting a little longer than normal for our food. 

We placed our entree orders for the broiled wild caught swordfish steak and and the crispy Panko fried wild New England cod.

Our calamari came out after about 15 minutes and looked like a children's portion of food. The container of sauce that was placed in the center of the appetizer took up a quarter of the plate and there was maybe a dozen small pieces of calamari tossed with some peppers. It wasn't hot- maybe luke warm- and wasn't cooked well at all. 

The oysters came out a few minutes later and were served over ice with cocktail sauce, a lemon wedge, and a vinegar pear sauce. They were okay, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed them enough. 

Our entrees came out and we were, again, severely disappointed with the quality of the food. The swordfish wasn't seasoned well and lacked flavor. The rice was okay, but had maybe two pieces of the andouille sausage that was supposed to be in it and the portion size wasn't impressive. 

My boyfriend's cod dish came with 3 of the smallest pieces of fish I've ever seen served in a fish and chips entree, no lemon, and with soggy fries. 

We left without ordering dessert and unsatisfied. 

Overall, I'd give the service an 8/10 (the only reason for the 3rd star in this review) and the food quality for the price a 4/10. 

There are a ton of other great places to dine in Disney Springs and I would highly recommend spending your money at one of them. The Boathouse definitely did not live up to its high praises and I don't think we will be back again.",restaurant

2676,"Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen, although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka J√§rvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries. But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance. (And many of them still do...at least on some level...) <br /><br />Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially J√ºri J√§rvet (perhaps the best known Estonian actor, plays Snaut in Tarkovski's Solaris), playing and old gangster who's slowly becoming tired of his way of life. But the most astonishing performance comes from Monika M√§ger, a child-actor playing Terje, a boyish girl in her early teens, whose presence in the plot is quite essential. (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list!!!)w<br /><br />There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does that. Unfortenately J√§rvi-Laturi's other films are far from this kind of achievements. His first one, Kotia p√§in was too artificial and his latest, History is Made at Night was just a weird mess.",movie

Garbo is completely believable as a top Parisian artist's model and completely at home, although bored, with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals. Suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. She finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty, only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own. Ironically, he intends to marry and keep her on the side - so much for his pure moral ethic of earlier.<br /><br />The scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens. Only Marjorie Rambeau as Lulu is able to inject life into the proceedings with such lines as ""Unfortunately weak women have strong appetites"" and ""Odette, Where is thy sting?""<br /><br />Only for Garbo fans.",movie

2694,"Hayley Phillips had no place to go to safely raise her newborn Lily, so she came to Memphis' legendary Harper House hoping to obtain work from her distant relative forty-something Roz Harper at the attached In the Garden nursery (see BLUE DAHLIA). She has found much more as she becomes friends with her curmudgeon host, Stella and others who shower her and Lily with love. However over time, Hayley realizes she also loves Roz's son Harper, but fears revealing her deep feelings because she worries how Roz and their friends would react; not even love is worth the cost of that friendship. Besides she has doubts that the deep regard is truly hers as she thinks the Harper Bride has somehow entered her mind. Harper shares her feelings including not wanting to hurt their friendship that means so much to him.Hayley believes the Harper Bride, a ghost singing lullabies in the mansion, has chosen her as the one to help the spirit leave this plane. Accompanied by Harper, Roz and her beloved Mitchell (see BLACK ROSE), and Stella and her cherished Logan they begin a quest to learn what happened in 1893 to keep this specter haunting the mansion.RED LILY is a terrific ending to the delightful In the Garden trilogy. Haley fantasizes about Harper and dreams of things that happened to the Harper Bride not her. This makes her wonder if the Bride or she loves Harper. The ensemble cast returns from the previous novels, but remains consistent to their distinctive personalities. The mystery of the ghost and the potential romance make for a fine finale as the audience will wonder whether the Bride, Haley, or both loves Harper. Nora Roberts proves once again she is one of the best writers in the romance world.Harriet Klausner",book

According to Eisenberg, every one of us carries around in our heads a number that should we acquire it would generate sufficient cash flow to carry us through retirement. The problem, as Eisenberg points out, is that we frequently change our retirement desires which in turn causes us to keep tweaking the number. The point of the book is to suggest that the number is less essential than coming to grips with our emotions and assess what we really want out of life. A quick read yet a powerful ""punch in the gut"" truth that helps to focus on what is important. Excellent self-help book. Highly recommended.",book

This author has a way of pulling the reader right into the story. I love the descriptions of the painter's complicated family. I have read the book twice (audio) just to be sure I heard everything.

2706,"I liked this movie. Unlike other thrillers you learn to know the killers very well. You also get to know the two detectives hunting them. The killers are two high school kids. They are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police so they plan the ""perfect crime"". We all know this crime will not turn out perfect. What we don't know is if they will be caught, or may be just one of them, or even none. In a way I kind of hoped they both would get away with it, although I don't know if this was the movies intention.<br /><br />The story is told in a nice way. You are starting to get to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is likable but has her own secret, which works against her. Ben Chaplin is pretty good as Sam and the two kids are both great. The scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie.<br /><br />I think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think.

There's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where Joan Cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on TV.<br /><br />This isn't only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated, but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beings.<br /><br />A low-key, subtle movie with good acting (especially from Hurt, who I don't always like so much) and apt direction.",movie

Brent Spiner proves that ""Data"" from Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play.<br /><br />The storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and I laughed heartily throughout this movie and I highly recommend it.",movie
2715,"In '1001 Midnights -The Aficionado's Guide to Mystery and Detective Fiction,' Bill Pronzini hailed 'A Sad Song Singing' as ""one of the ten best private-eye novels ever written.""Crescentia (Cress) Fanio, unwanted at home, is a 17 year old high school dropout and folk music aficionado. She had lived for four months with her lover Richie Darden, a 25 year old itinerant folk musician. Richie left her a locked suitcase with instructions not to open it until he returned.Cress seeks out 35 year old detective Mac (no last name revealed) to find her missing lover and to protect her from three men she believes want to kill her and Richie.Mac is a quiet and tough detective, a light drinker with a moderate temperament. Cress remains fiercely loyal to her departed boyfriend and is ready to fight to maintain possession of the suitcase. The characters are not particularly well developed, and there is little meaningful conversation between Mac and Cress. At one point Mac reflects, ""I had no way to read what was in her mind."" A reader wants to shout, ""Why don't you ask her?""This book, published in 1963, gives an interesting glimpse into the folk music craze in America of the late 1950's/early 1960's. Cress and Mac visit folk-music coffeehouses and even a hootenanny (a large folk music gathering with audience participation).In a disturbance at one coffee house, Mac thwarts police efforts to harass patrons and unjustly arrest a Black American. During this era, many folk musicians had close ties with the civil rights movement and other social justice causes, and this tie-in is nicely revealed in this scene.The plot is basic and simple - find Ritchie and keep the pursuers from harming Cress or stealing the suitcase. Pronzini praises the book for its ""emotional depth and impact."" I suspect that the impact would be greatest for those born in the 1940's or earlier who loved folk music. I found Dewey's lean prose to be at times understated to the point of flatness. The background details of growing up during the folk movement had some interest, but I was not hugely moved by the one-dimensional characters.There is a 'coming of age' story line in the concluding chapters as Cress starts to perform and finds her calling as a singer. I found this plot thread to be rushed and heavy handed, but you may find it poignant.Mac appeared in a total of 16 novels, beginning in 1947. Mac is often credited for being the first modern compassionate PI, setting the stage for Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer, Michael Collin's Dan Fortune, and Bill Pronzini's Nameless.Bottom Line: An entertaining diversion of 192 pages, with insights into the urban folk music scene before the Beatles visited the USA.",book

The so-called aunt is actually part of the demi monde , smuggler and prostitute, abettor of a Nazi collaborator and a con man, possibly an adjunct to a murder. The British Empire-type characters might have been fashioned by Agatha Christie in the 20's and 30's. The only hint that the book was written in the '60's is the young American hippie girl the banker meets on the Orient Express to Istanbul.

Household appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuums, and a waffle maker) stand in for Ty-fighters, X-wings, R2D2, and the death star. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, complete with Cinnabon hairdo. You get the point, I'm sure. Mad silliness, and a fun ride for any Star Wars geek (like me!)<br /><br />Now, the DVD - wow!

Salmon croquettes were not right, something was lagging in the first taste wave. Rice grains were cooked great and were not mushy. Gravy tasted homemade, I will give it to you. That cabbage though??

Chicken wings were not done enough to my liking and I don't favor the darker colors towards the bones, no siree bob. The area of which this is located is actually pretty significant.

Truly Madly Yours is one of those books. To put simply, I finished it barely 3 minutes ago and I'm already looking forward to re-reading my favorite parts.A lot of the reviews cover the plot line so I won't go into the details again. I have to admit I was really skeptical and turned off by the fact that, technically, the two leads are siblings (not by blood, but still). That plus the cliched chick-lit story line (which, of course, I expected) and slow pace of the book made it difficult for me to get into at first. But the book is so well written, the love story so well developed, that I was quickly convinced. Of all the things I love about this book, my favorite has to be how the author deliberately builds the connection between the leads very, very slowly. You actually FEEL the love story happen, rather than just read about it.Like I said at the start, it is the basic boy/girl story line with a few cliches thrown in here and there (yes, we get it, he's a great kisser; let's move on now!), but I've enjoyed this light read so much, I'm not even bothered by it.Before reading this, Jennifer Crusie's ""Bet Me"" was my favorite romance novel; now this one is right up there with it.",book

After a couple of outstanding cocktails (Bombay Saphire and Bartlett Pear Martini), we ventured into the current wine list, which, while not extensive, has a nice selection of varietals from many vineyards.  We stuck with the ""by the glass"" section of the wine list and selected a Cade sauvignon blanc and the Stags Leap Investor (a red blend).  Both wines were spectacular, and recommended if you stop by.  Our food selections hit the mark, beginning with the grilled artichoke hearts, an old staple at Bartlett's and still very good.  We inquired about crab cakes, and while not on the menu, they were available.  A conversation with the waiter revealed the crab cakes are a frequent special, alternating with lobster tails.  Bartlett's crab cakes are easily in the top 2 or 3 in ATX.  (Get the sauce on the side).  The cost is pretty crazy, but, heck, they're darn good!  The club salad and fresh fish of the day followed, both were outstanding.  We also selected an extra side dish, Thai roasted brussel sprouts with crushed peanuts ... sublime!  The gastro adventure ended with Barlett's key lime pie, which was amazing.  Service was great, attentive but not overbearing, thank you Andrew.  It was an incredible meal, start to finish.

2729,"I find it very odd that many of the previous reviewers said that they were unable to care about the characters in this book. I can't recall a book in which I cared about the characters _more_. They seemed like real people, and the footnotes (which I thought brilliant) simply made them seem more so. Not only did the characters seem real, but so did the world that Ms. Clarke created for them (or did she create the characters for the world, one wonders?). I am a voracious reader and have seldom, if ever, seen an imaginary world as fully realized as this--not even books with a modern, realistic setting are as convincing when it comes to perfectly rendered, but invisibly deployed details. This is the first book that I've read since I was a teenager that felt ""right,"" the first that I've wanted to hug when I finished it and the first that I ever had the (unfullfilled) urge to copy out onto my walls in tiny gold writing. I cannot deny that this book is not for everyone--a reader must like omniscient narrators, be sufficiently interested in details to explore (and enjoy!) the footnotes, and not be afraid of the rhythms of slightly formal speech and poetic description--but the rewards for those who _do_ read it are manifold. This book--with it's intricate setting, believable characters and gripping story--may become the standard by which I judge all following books that I read.An aside (or footnote, if you will): I believe that retail books are sold shrink-wrapped for one of two reasons. Either the book contains photographs or other pages that would be tempting to tear out, or (as in this case) the shrink-wrap serves to prevent the book from warping under its own weight if placed at the end of a row. I doubt that any bookseller, much as they might like to, would shrink-wrap something to obscure its lack of worth. :)",book

Throughout the five hours, ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be intelligent and caring, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother.

The main male hero is your typical world-weary ex-cop, the other is your typical world-weary cop who gets by by ignoring the police bureaucracy; the heroine is a golden girl. The villains are completely craven, witheringly stupid and so self-absorbed that they are blind to their own stupidity. The plot breezes by, accompanied by lots of outlandish setups guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. About the only serious notes creep in when the author scores some points about protecting the Everglades, which is fine. Just a fun read for the summer or for a long airplane ride.

2743,"If I could have given this film 0/10 I would, and this is the first film I have wanted to rate so low. Its worse than awful. If I went to see it in the cinema I would want the cinema to pay ME for watching it (at least minimum wage). Some of the camera shots were quite effective, but a lot were rubbish eg. villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side-ways from his body (seeing is believing). Several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions/facial expressions when they were shot. I only watched it to the end (fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue) hoping to see Seagal in some decent hand to hand combat, but there was almost none of that (should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - end of 'action' scene). In one scene we see Seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact). The chief villain keeps coming back to life. He gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions. The 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd/3rd floor onto the street. To sum up, this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. It looks very low budget (even for Seagal). The colour is dull and grey. I could go on and on....just like this film, but I wont.

2748,"A Fun Read With Some Minor FlawsTony Bourdain's ""A Cook's Tour"" is a fun book to read. I plowed through it voraciously in a matter of days. I watched the companion series on the Food Network and enjoyed it thoroughly. I was concerned that the book would be a mere rehashing of the series and was relieved and pleased to find this was not the case.Tony's adventures are well written and his humor comes through loud and clear. I particularly liked the chapters on Vietnam and Russia, probably because he enjoyed those countries so much. His return with his brother to his ancestral village in France is also a well-written and intriguing episode in the book.The book suffers somewhat from a lack of cohesion. The book has a number of chapters on Vietnam, but it breaks them up with chapters about other countries. For me, this was rather jarring. It was exacerbated by the lack of any kind of introduction or segue between the chapters. At times, it felt like I was reading a series of magazine articles that had been compiled, rather than a book which was conceived as a whole.At times, he also lets his preconceptions of a country get in the way of his gaining a better understanding of its cuisine - Morocco and Cambodia being cases in point.The other complaint I have about the book is his repeated tirades against vegetarians (full disclosure: I am a longtime lacto-ovo vegetarian). He is certainly entitled to his opinion, but I think that three or four separate tirades on the subject in a slime volume is rather much. I find his primary complaint, that vegetarians are ruining cuisine, to be absurd. At the end of one of his invectives, he concludes the enemy of real cuisine is fast food and overly processed food, which is probably closer to the mark.All in all, it is a fascinating book even with its flaws. As Tony notes, simple food, honestly prepared, is often the most pleasurable, whether it is a spring roll wrapped in lettuce with basil or a dumpling followed by a shot of vodka. I really enjoyed most of ""A Cook's Tour"", and I do owe Tony a debt for improving my cooking with his recommendations from his book ""Kitchen Confidential"" - using shallots and finishing dishes off with butter. And if he would like a wonderful food experience which happens to be vegetarian, all he has to do is stroll down to Hangawi on East 32nd Street for an amazing dining experience, honestly and simply prepared.",book

2750,"We went for the $35 Dine Out menu and it was good enough that I think I'd like to come back and try their regular menu. I'm usually hesitant with fusion places--I love all foods but with fusion, I find something gets lost in translation.

But I liked the food here and the choices were all interesting. I had:
Chicken Seoul Good: I've had better Korean fried chicken in Korean restaurants. This batter is not as crunchy though I still enjoyed it and the pairing of the mushroom gravy was interesting. Imagine drinking cream of mushroom with some fried chicken, odd but it works.
Uni-Versal Pasta: This was good and so aesthetically pleasing but the pasta was lacking in flavour. I couldn't really get a sense of the uni cream sauce in the description and was glad I opted for the additional uni on top ($7). I guess because the pasta itself was a bit bland, the prawns were quite salty so it balanced out when I ate them together. The uni was very good, very creamy.
Luv U So Matcha: Such a tiny but delicious tart! I'm not huge on tart or pie crusts but the matcha filling was just so good and not very sweet.

I was also impressed with their selection of mocktails (I think there were 4 or 5) because it's hard to find good ones in restaurants but I don't enjoy cocktails so it's nice that they offer alternatives. They also had a selection of sodas and kombucha, as well as cocktails of course.

Our server was also lovely and the restaurant itself is spacious and beautiful. We made reservations beforehand and they had reserved a nice table by the window. Even though the food wasn't amazing, it definitely piqued my interest and makes me want to come back to try something else.",restaurant
2751,"I loved this classic French novel by Jules Verne and found it to be very entertaining from start to finish! I was very surprised that I would enjoy this book as much as I did.... I figured ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", like many classic novels, would be boring, but Jules Verne is a marvelous storyteller. He imbues this novel with lots of intrigue and mystery as you wonder how the story will unfold... There is lots of adventure and interesting predicaments, and of course, many unforgettable characters one comes to care about during the course of the novel. Also if you like science fiction then this is the novel for you! Jules Verne seems to be ahead of his time in terms of technology and creates quite a wonderful piece of classic literature that has stood the test of time.The attention to detail that Jules Verne used to capture the readers attention is marvelous... This book is written in the 1st person through the eyes of Assistant Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Paris Museum of Natural History. Professor Aronnax unfolds the story to the reader of this novel about several sightings of a mysterious object seen around the world by many different people.... Some believe it to be an island, others seem to think the object is a floating reef, a large whale or other large mammal and so on. It isn't until Professor Aronnax and his faithful Flemish assistant, Conseil, take part on an expedition aboard the Abraham Lincoln to seek out this unknown object once and for all. Eventually, it is discovered that this unknown object is a submarine named the Nautilus, on which Professor Aronnax, Conseil and Canadian harpooner, Ned Land, spend the remaining part of the novel sailing on the Nautilus through the various oceans of the world along with the crew of the Nautilus. What adventures they have while sailing on the Nautilus!! And the exquisite detail in which Jules Verne imparts is wonderful. One feels like they are truly reading the actually travel journal/diary of Professor Aronnax. Professor Aronnax writes from a scientific/natural history perspective as he is very much interested in the under water world of the worlds oceans.The only draw back I had with this novel was that some of the descriptions were a bit overdone or a bit too much to take in (like classification of animal species or various nautical terms).... These descriptions aren't overwhelming or occur that frequently, I'd just find myself skimming through these parts rather quickly.",book

Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless, but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didn't click. One of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and i hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original.

It still points out ways we enable, but it is very helpful to give a little bit different perspective, insight and instruction as to how to recover yourself and how to repair your spirit. It is a very good follow up to Boundries with Your Adult Childresn by A. Bottke and Boundries When to Say Yes and When to Say No by Henry Cloud.... Best follow up for me in that this book tied up some loose ends (in my attempt to educate myself about addiction) regarding the role I have played in the the lives of my adult-child addicts. It clarified some concepts of my responsibility, and reinforced others from yet another perspective of a male parent who has two addicted adult children. It is, however, a powerful stand alone if you read nothing else but this. It is most helpful for me right now to read things specifically for parents. Other material helps, but I find books addressing issues for parents of adult-child addicts is more relevant to me at this point.",book

2758,"The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the dig.<br /><br />To be as brief as possible, Pharaoh's Curse is quite the lackluster affair. While the movie does present a few good, original ideas (blood sucking mummy's, soul transference, interesting make-up effects, the arm ripping scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. To make matters even worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding. I usually go for these slow moving mummy movies, but Pharaoh's Curse tests even my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the lone bright spot ¬ñ wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character), the cast is as dull as the screenplay. Finally, I don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what appears to be pajamas, but it's a laughable, ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience.<br /><br />Despite my mostly negative comments on the Pharaoh's Curse, I'm going to rate it a 4/10.

I met my son there & we were greeted by a friendly, mask-wearing team member who informed us of specials & available services.  We ordered food, grabbed beverages & went outside to wait.

2766,"I came to watch Guerrilla, part two of Steven Soderbergh's biopic of Che Guevara, without having seen the preceding film and without more than a cursory knowledge of Che's life. At the same time I was rather apprehensive that this would be both a heavy-going history lesson and an unrepentant love-letter to the iconic revolutionary. As it turns out, this film far exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Guerrilla works remarkably well as a standalone film. The story of Che's failed attempt to lead a revolution in Bolivia, then under military rule, is a compelling tragedy. The initial impetus brought by Che's arrival incognito to lead the guerrilla war is lost as misfortune follows misfortune. The odds stack up against the revolutionaries. US backing for the Bolivian army, hostile conditions in the rainforest, suspicious locals and Che's failing health are just some of the difficulties which beset the nascent rebellion.<br /><br />Soderbergh's portrayal of Che is largely uncritical, but this film is no hagiography. The style is refreshingly undramatic, with a subtle and effective soundtrack by Alberto Iglesias adding quiet drama to many scenes. Che is undoubtedly the centre of the film but there are very few close-ups of his face and we are encouraged to see the people fighting alongside him and sometimes against him too. Where Soderbergh wishes to demonstrate Che's virtues we see it in small episodes such as the loyal acolyte who upbraids two fellow guerrillas when they question Che's leadership, and emphasises the sacrifice that he has made in leaving behind Cuba to fight again for revolution.<br /><br />The direction throughout is superb. Part two feels tightly edited despite its narrow focus and is able to communicate a great deal through images without the need for a narrator to spell things out for the audience. At the start of the film we see a few short clips of lavish parties in post-revolutionary Cuba, immediately furnishing us with ideas as to why Che would sacrifice his old life to fight again in another country. Later on, the portrayal of guerrillas marching through the unending rainforests stands out as a strikingly beautiful scene and helps to create a feeling of the enormity of the task before this tiny band of revolutionaries.<br /><br />If there is a problem with the film it is the distance between the viewer and Che, which, though it does allow us to appreciate the context of the insurgency and the people around him, makes it hard for us to understand him better as a person. True, Benicio Del Toro is utterly convincing in the lead role ¬ñ so much so that it is difficult to remember that you are watching an actor and not the man himself. However, watching Guerrilla as a standalone film means that we are given precious little insight into what is shaping Che's thoughts, words and actions. It is to be hoped that this is more to the fore in the first part of Soderbergh's biopic (I cannot comment on that yet), and certainly the strength of part two is making me look forward eagerly to seeing the prequel.",movie
2767,"I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week.<br /><br />It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his. After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot.<br /><br />The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign, they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere. <br /><br />It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me. I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress.

2774,"Lua is a gem among programming languages. Its designers have commendably placed a high value on keeping the language small, readable and portable. The diminutive size and simple syntax of Lua, however, belie a very rich, highly factored and stable architecture. It is a fun language in which to program. Lua dovetails beautifully with lower level languages by means of a C interface, and its drum tight language processor and libraries are right at home in event-driven graphical applications as well as console programs.The excellent book &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; by Roberto Ierusalimschy provides developers with a broad summary of the language. The author includes a myriad of small examples, each of which is well focused and easily grasped. Different solutions to a given problem are often accompanied by benchmark figures. Prof. Ierusalimschy has an educator's gift for finding the appropriate level at which to write, and readers will appreciate the conversational nature of his writing. Unlike many programming language books, &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; has a strong content-to-fluff ratio throughout.The book provides valuable explanations of language and library features which even the careful reader of the Lua reference manual might miss. In addition, over twenty C library entry points are discussed (and, thankfully, indexed) which are not mentioned in the reference manual.It is hard to conceive of a software project which would not benefit from using Lua, both as an embedded component and as a standalone interpreter of scripts.

2779,"There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan's 'Ned Kelly' film did. Initially I had heard only half hearted recommendations, and decided to see it for myself. Since then, I have acquired both the video and soundtrack, and have to say that after several viewings, I am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film. It is also wonderful to see something Australian! I appreciate its down to earth quality, that if you ask me is a rarity, as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films. This film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point. The cast was a bonus, including a variety of well known, and might I add, good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters. It is interesting to note, that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what, and how they only said so many lines. However, if any criticism is due, it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded. In reality, these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in Australian history. For example, on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much, much more to the relationship between Joe Byrne and Aaron Sheritt, and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film. Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only Aaron Sheritt's efforts alone, that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery. Yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention. I feel that in this case, this is the only limitation. However, I can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation. It certainly inspired me to look more closely. So, watch it and decide for yourself. You might not like it at all, thats your opinion, and thats fine. Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience? For me, I'd call it a breath of fresh air!",movie

I think that those of us who asre now alumni can look back at the experince now and agree with Ms. King. Personally, I think she went far easier on the school than most of us would have. She provides a very neutral view about things. Except for a minor critique of the nuns ( and hwo wouldn't critique sister christine), and a little stress about grades, the book is very uninsulting.

2782,"I was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn't able to excite, really scare or shock me - there was one part in the entire film that I thought was gruesome but even that didn't redeem it. I did get to like the character of Kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this film and I think the director/writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose, if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate's part, it may have worked - Jeremy's acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it.

2783,"A weird, witty and wonderful depiction of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall has written something that is funny, foreboding and occasionally frightening! Yes, don't be fooled by 2point4 children's cheerful tune and bubbly characters; the show has a dark side, and at times can be quite chilling. And that's what's so good about the show, it's not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2D comic device (the case with My Family). Instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full roller-coaster of human emotions. The occasionally dark moments such as Bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and Ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal, dark turn, that help add a little depth. Of course the show is also incredibly funny, and is a guaranteed to make you smile. It's a real shame Eureka Video have stopped releasing this comical gold on DVD.

2785,"Novels such as these convince me that the larger the story, the more profound will be its ending. There are too many features to this book to do it justice. The basic story line follows Edmund Dantes, a young sailor accused of treason. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, but (as one can guess might happen) he manages an escape. The rest of the novel follows his plan to revenge himself. The whole while, the reader never knows how evil prison has made Dantes, and the possibility that he will spare no one in his mission is quite plausible. What emerges is a suspense in terms of plot and character intertwined.Anyone interested in reading a huge book, but unsure which one to try first, this would be my top recomendation. Dumas' style is suited to suspense, adventure, and action, but is also moving and has penetrating insights into humanity. One will also find a wealth of descriptiveness to let your imagination absorb itself into another world. It is easy to read, and easy to pick up where you left off, in case you need to take a break from it.",book

2787,"The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.<br /><br />The film starts out in a flurry as Bourne is running from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. Or does it? The time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. They aren't his target. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well.<br /><br />The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. All in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.",movie

Baldwin is simply just a second league compared to McQueen. I watched it just out of curiosity, being a huge fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost a B movie with second rate acting and directing. I wasn't even disappointed, I just don't know what they were trying to do. This remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era.<br /><br />It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.<br /><br />This is a complete waste of your time.

2790,"I had the pleasure of screening ""The Big Bad Swim"" at the 2006 New London Film Festival last week. The festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream films from the past year. It was my assumption that ""The Big Bad Swim"" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around Eastern Connecticut. However, as the credits began to roll I could only think about how well ""The Big Bad Swim"" compared to the others featured during the festival. By far it topped my list, followed by ""The Puffy Chair"", ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" and ""Transamerica"".<br /><br />The ""The Big Bad Swim"" is an engaging, truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that I've not seen on screen in quite a while. The interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which I found refreshing. The plot doesn't beat you over the head with a direction; rather it builds and grows organically with a pace that was spot on. I was never bored. I never cringed. I never stepped out of the story on the screen.<br /><br />The humor of the film is something like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""Old School"". The acting from a group of relatively unknown actors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived. Obviously not being a multi-million production the camera shot weren't all awe-inspiring and clear, but adequate and well done for the budget. The lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in ""Closer"". I also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be.<br /><br />I sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry, but I have to say it: If ""The Big Bad Swim"" isn't picked up for some kind of distribution I would extremely disappointed. ""The Big Bad Swim"" needs to be seen. If you have the chance to see this film, SEE IT! Disappointment is impossible!",movie

America in the 22nd century is an armed fortress that has cut itself off in protectionism from the rest of the world for 200 years due to the wars in Europe. So much time has passed that the people think that Britain and Europe are nothing but legends.

What anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at. It's the same with ""First Kid"", which follows a similar pattern. Certain movies - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense. Such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course these movies lack quality, lack a sophisticated storyline, very often lack first-class acting, but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that's okay.

2796,"This novel by E.J. DiStefano is simply the most thought provoking piece of fiction I've read in a very long time! It is an easy read (thankfully), which I've rarely found in novels that require the readers to ask themselves such deep questions concerning faith and sexuality. DiStefano writes this novel in first-person and uses the traditional scriptural interpretations as the frame work for providing his own version of the Gospels. This could very easily be considered an historical, alternative version of the Jesus story that provides the gay/lesbian community and their supporters with a bible of their own that proclaims that, Yes, you too, are beloved children of God! I highly recommend Beloved Testament to everyone, regardless of your current religious, or sexual orientation.Lisa Bauer",book
2797,"I went in duRing their sofT open.  Just moved to Austin area, living in Round Rock.  Had a meetinG nearby and stopped in on a lark.  I am use to real Korean BBQ in Seattle, LA and Korea.  I have eaten in similar types of BBQ places in a bunch of USA cities.  The first thing is they are NOT a BBQ place.  They do not have table grills, with hoods.  They also do not serve all of the various side dishes as is normal, usually 6-10 small side dishes are served.  In short, this is a highly abridged Korean food place.

I ordered Galbi, Bulgoogi, a spicy stew and spicy egg/rice, and veggies dish.  It was good quality food and had ok flavors.  They warned me that they are cooking for an Austin palate.  In short, the flavor and quality of cooking was solid, very clean tastes, just a little light on Korean traditional spicing.

2798,"This gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing ""Reckless"" -- but you'll have plenty of fun. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. You won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before.)",movie

The book rivals anything by Sidney Sheldon as it reveals a suspensful tale of betrayals, love and redemption.And the dialogue is so real and believable--- full of lessons that all of us can relate to and apply to either ourselves or someone we know.For example: ""There has to be more to life than this. (p.37)"" ""You gotta be a man and money don't make you a man. (p.209)"", ""If you're going to be a drug dealer at least be smart about it.

2804,"In general, I enjoy how Nathaniel Hawthorne singles Hester out and makes this book about psychological isolation, rather than a physical isolation. He sheds light on society, unafraid to advocate the cause of free thought and humanism, whether it be mankind's feats or flaws.The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne explores the human flaws of an intricate Puritan society, in which Hester Prynne is victimized; however, through a different point of view, she is actually fortunate to gain great insight and wisdom, as she triumphs over societal expectations. The Puritan community requires its citizens to act proper with decorum. When Hester violates that very belief, she becomes shunned from society. Devastated in the beginning, but she is quick to realize that it is not she that is odd, when in fact, it is the whole community that is at fault for treating her with malice. Instead of perishing in despair, like the town expects, she actually grows stronger everyday mentally. Contrary to what the town believes, Hester boldly opposes the norm, which in this case is a subtle flaw. As a result, Hester gains insight and wisdom, a gift that the town will never be able to attain. Thus, Nathaniel Hawthorne takes a stab at human flaws in the Puritan society, by revealing its foolishness through the eyes of Hester Prynne.In my opinion, Hawthorne is adept at pointing out society's flaws, and he writes what he truly believes so his audience would see the obscured flaws of society. Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter investigates the human flaws of a Puritan Society through the eyes of Hester, who ultimately triumphs over societal expectations; Hawthorne argues that in order for one to truly perceive flaws of an entity, one has to be boldly detached and thus objective of that entity. Hester is the epitome of a bold individual, who cares less about societal expectations, when she learns that it is not she that is peculiar, but it is the town that is unusual. It is not until then that she truly takes an objective stance and explores and studies the Puritan community. Able to overcome the initial despairs of desolation, Hester ultimately prevails through her eventual apathy towards the town's views. She does exactly what society does not expect her to do. Instead of diminishing, she stands even stronger than before, an attitude that annoys the rest. It is then that an individual truly defies the norm and understands societal flaws.I find that Hawthorne's theme in this book is much like that of The Catcher in the Rye. The idea of completely transforming a weakness into a strength is illustrated in both The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger demonstrated by Hester Prynne and Holden Caulfield, respectively. Both protagonists are shunned from society because of their inability to demonstrate ""normal"" behaviors; however, it is that very individuality that rewards them wisdom and insight of the societal flaws.",book

Fantastic. And set in Paris! This could be great. But unfortunately, Korrine may spark the odd decent idea but because he is an awful writer, the story fails on every level and the audience walkout I witnessed about an hour in is proof positive that he is the most boring and pretentious film-making out there.

I don't mind getting an education but the incessant use of ""big"" words diminished the credibility of the main character. Who really uses this kind of vocabulary so frequently either in thought or in speaking? Instead of visualizing a character all I could see was an author with a thesauraus by his side looking for opportunities to flaunt his penchant for polysyllabic and obscure words. And following the sentences/character's line of thought is a constant chore. The main character is smug and seems to feel she's funnier (especially with her wordplay) than she actually is. This book just made me feel dumb...like I'm not smart enough to ""get it"". Overall a pretentious, elitist book that makes James Joyce's stuff seem light and breezy.",book

2817,"Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. The nature of class war was always going to be a subject worthy of poking fun at, but this TV series exploits it better than most. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote almost entirely flawless episodes every time. In my opinion, it is the best British sitcom of the mid to late-1970s, surpassing the likes of RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST, ARE YOU BEING SERVED? and so on. With the ON THE BUSES series having finished a few years earlier, GEORGE AND MILDRED became the next pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1 as it's now known), enjoying a four-year run on the channel.<br /><br />The movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every respect. The general essence of the TV series has almost entirely been stripped by the writers of this abysmal movie (who anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series). As one commenter has already pointed out, Mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the TV series and does not come across as anywhere near as overbearing.<br /><br />The plot, instead of focusing on the class war with the Fourmiles that was the very foundation of the TV series, actually writes out the Fourmiles almost entirely after the first half-hour. The plot, if you can call it that, consists of George and Mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters. First rate talent in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are all wasted here. Most of these are well past their heyday and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck (which probably won't be much).<br /><br />The jokes and gags in the movie (if you can call them that) rely heavily upon traditional British farce, including mistaken identities, embarrassing situations, poorly-timed slapstick, characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion. And it all fails miserably. As another commenter has pointed out, it seems as though the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the TV series and instead crafted out a something resembling a CARRY ON romp. The scene where George is stripped down by Sue Bond's character is particularly out of context.<br /><br />A mystery surrounding this movie is the BBFC certification provided - 15. Just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless, non-vulgar entertainment?<br /><br />Not surprisingly the era of sitcom spin-of came to an end not long after this movie was released (shortly after the sad death of Yootha Joyce). And the company behind this movie, Hammer, well known for producing first rate horror movies back in the 1950s to mid 1970s, soon disappeared into total obscurity.<br /><br />All in all, the movie is a near total washout. My advice - skip this and stick to the TV series. You won't be missing anything, I assure you.",movie

2819,"Yaitate!! Japan is a really fun show and I really like it! It was shown in our country just recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. It is about Azuma Kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream to make Japanese bread that will represent his country. He is working in the Southern Toyo branch of Pantasia and he is also helping his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St. Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight other skillful bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different kinds of bread but also learn to cook other food. It is a really funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime(like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece)and famous people from real life. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is really a must-see for people of different ages.",movie

It's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.<br /><br />The sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. Some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. <br /><br />""The Eye"" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas ""The Eye 2"" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. Omit watching this. Watching ""The Eye"" is good enough.",movie
2821,"Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: legendary South American goat-sucking vampire, El Chupacabra, is on the loose, feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra expert/author Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) attempt to track down the creature, but find their progress hampered by a pair of dumb cops, money hungry locals keen to capture the beast for a fat reward, and a couple of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments.<br /><br />Stinking higher than a two-week-old taco, El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies might struggle to sit through. With its dreadful script, awful direction (by not one, but two talentless hacks¬óBrennon Jones and Paul Wynne), laughable dialogue, and some of the worst acting this side of a porn flick, I recommend this film about as much as I do drinking the tap water in Mexico.<br /><br />As Navarro and Starlina proceed with their investigations, viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore, the worst designed book jacket in history, the most unconvincing dead person I've seen since the blinking corpse in Dr. Butcher MD, and a high-tech computerised security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post.<br /><br />To be fair, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster itself is fairly creepy (hairy, with big claws, and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearances are few and far between, with more screen time spent on the tedious trials and tribulations of whiney Officer Navarro than on the killer antics of the titular creature (just how many times is it necessary to see Navarro handing in paperwork to his bitchy boss?).<br /><br />If, like me, you make the mistake of wasting your hard-earned cash on this dreadful latino bilge (in my case, it was a whole 50p), consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it.",movie
2822,"I bought this a while back, during a massive martial arts movie phase. Although this certainly ain't the best, I do love this kind of film making, and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, I always appreciate the fact that, whilst he lacked formal martial arts training, he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. He also has a good beard. This movie has him in a good, heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies, he still acquits himself well. Early appearances from Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also nice too see, especially for the fact that Chow Yun Fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play. He may not be a great fighter but he does OK. Eddy Ko is as great a bad guy as ever, he performs the same villainry as in many of his other films and does it great, as per usual. The fellow who plays Bu is good too, I don't recall his name, but he's in Magnificent Butcher too. Although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era, The postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination, quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance. There are some very nifty scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mixture of Hong Kong talents all coming together to decent effect. All in all, I would recommend this to kung fu and general Hong Kong action fans. It may not be a stylised classic like the Shaw Brothers films, or as crowd pleasing as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it is rock solid entertainment.",movie

2824,"I'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /><br />I had major problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. <br /><br />As for the dancing, I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. <br /><br />There were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.<br /><br />Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br /><br />Many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true. Watch ""The Little Mermaid"" instead.",movie

We were supposed to see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they were unable to show it, and instead substituted The Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed that we weren't going to be able to see the much hyped Duddy Kravitz, and had heard nothing of The Gravy Train, and have heard nothing of it since.<br /><br />However, I recall we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was, and as I recall, it was quite humorous.

2830,"Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a script that the screen-writers for ""Touched by an Angel"" might have passed up as being too impuissant, Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives but I found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that I think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones.<br /><br />This movie is at heart (pun intended) a story built on a big twist-style ending. This kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like Tornatore's Una Pura Formalit√† or god-awful garbage like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Cuore Sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter. I found the cinematography in general to be above average. The tracking shots of Irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta when Giancarlo comes in from the rain and Irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch. One big issue that I took exception to in this film was Ozpetek's method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place. This worked to fantastic effect in Facing Windows, but when employed here it seems that Bubolova is no Mezzogiorno. In fact besides the ridiculous story, the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of it's main character. It made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad. <br /><br />In this movie Ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate-driven societies by urging us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And while I'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view, I felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object. Could the characters have been anymore two-dimensional? I tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless. Was the ""evil"" aunt Eleonora anything more than a caricature? It goes for the people on the side of ""right"" too, like the ""good"" aunt Maria Clara and the elderly doorman Aurelio. And just in case we might have missed Ozpetek's point, he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries. <br /><br />This brings me to an interesting point about the director's use of color. He clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black, as well as Irene (when we first meet her and after her life-conversion), the evil aunt Eleonora, and of course the good but confused Padre Carras. Black is a color that suggests a definite course, the wearer's mind is set and emotionless. It is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor, the business suit. It is also the color of mourning, such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo. Finally, black is the color of piety, such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that Irene emulates in the second half of the film. <br /><br />The other main color, and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart, is red. It is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component. The character who wears red is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas, and indulgent. Red is a risky color in modern times; it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable. Yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism, as the earliest members of Cro-Magnon man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the Torah, Adam, is named after the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor, looking back on the past where red (and by association a less self-driven attitude towards life) was more accepted. So when we encounter the red-filled room (the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a Whirling Dervish!) of Irene's mother, ""good"" characters Maria Clara and Aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red, and finally the painting of Irene's mother in a formal red gown we can see where Ozpetek's sympathies lie.<br /><br />A word or two about the soundtrack, I found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story. The quasi-baroque theme that signified Irene was great for it's monotony and feeling of restive malaise (the absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, with it's masterful repetitions of an 8-bar sarabande attributed to Handel). One absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while Irene is chasing Benny through the house. It is of the famous aria ""Ebben? ... Ne andr√≤ lontano"" from Catalani's opera ""La Wally"". The aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever. As Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter, as in the movie Irene is soon destined to never again see Benny alive. I just have one minor question of the soundtrack, why include the famous tango Yo Soy Maria? I love the song and personally could hear it all the time, but it didn't really fit here.",movie

2832,"Most of America has not yet caught on to the Discworld series, but those of us who have are fiercely devout followers, and this book is a prime example of why. On the surface, it is a hilarious and touching story of a once-mighty god and his last remaining believer, but Pratchett's astounding wisdom and understanding of human nature take it much deeper, through labyrinths literal, metaphorical, and moral. At the center are the questioning of a religion where belief centers on the church, rather than the god, and the way a sole believer can shift his god's way of thinking and take a religion with it.At the same time, Pratchett employs his usual side-splitting humor and vile puns to show us the silly side of serious philosophy, atheism in a world with thousands of gods, and exactly why tortoises hate eagles.

We roll up at 4:25 PM and there were people lining up at the door! Crazy, probably 20 + waiting to get a space at the bar. The doors unlocked and we all entered like when Filene's Basement had their annual Wedding Dress sale! Crazy rush to the bar and luckily there is about 40 bar seats.

I expected Cleese to have a large role since he had first billing, I was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time, along with everyone else I liked. This movie is amazingly pointless, the characters are nobodies, the plot is non-existent, and the ending is one of the worst endings I have ever seen. There were a few funny parts, but that's about it. Stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going ""What?"" and ""Huh?"", a lot. And if you don't want to waste your time.

2858,"Naked In Death is the first book in a series by Nora Roberts writing as JD Robb. Set in the year 2058, Lt. Eve Dallas is a smart, tough, take no prisoners NYC homicide detective. Because of an abusive childhood that she only remembers nightmarish snatches of, she allows few people to get close to her. Working on a high profile murder case she meets Roarke, billionaire industrialist, sexy as sin, and number one suspect. Much to her chagrin, Roarke is not all intimidated by the Lt. and gives as good as he gets. The relationship between these two is the backbone of this series. When they're together, sparks fly. Highly intelligent and strong-willed, they're also vulnerable, both with a dark past that they haven't completely overcome. This futuristic series gets better with each book. The plots are totally believable. Robb doesn't overwhelm you high-tech wizardry. Eve and Roarke's characters get more developed in each story, as do the other characters, Peabody, McNabb, Dr. Mira, Mavis, Feeney, and Summerset. You will not be disappointed.",book

2861,"Came here for dinner tonight. I really liked the ambience with the red lighting. Prices are reasonable and portions are decent. We came at 5pm so there wasn't a lot of people. I also liked how they had a nice selection of vegetarian options. 

Arancini (4.5/5)
This was my favourite dish of the night. The reason why I knocked off half a star is because there was a lot of shaved cheese on top which was too overpowering, especially since I dislike cheese. The tomato dipping sauce it came with was the perfect complement ! If it came without the cheese it would be a 5/5. I highly recommend this dish. 

Lamb poutine (4/5)
I didn't have this but my brother said that it was one of the better poutines that he's had - and he's had many poutines in his life. My parents enjoyed this as well. 

Fried cauliflower (3.5/5)
This was decent, but I thought it lacked flavour. the cauliflower wasn't too oily, and the batter wasn't overly thick. Not bad, but I don't think I would get this again. 

Vegetarian moussaka (4/5)
This was amazing - until you run out of the sauce on top. After that the whole thing tasted super bland and boring. If there was a lot more sauce, this dish would be a 5/5. I would recommend this dish, but maybe ask for more sauce ?

This was a nice experience, but I won't be making any special trips just to go to this place because it lacked a wow factor and it's too far from where I live. However, if you live nearby I would say that this is a pretty nice place to dine out. If I'm ever in the area I would probably drop by again.",restaurant

Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror.<br /><br />If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and, yes, it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions. <br /><br />Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad.",movie

This film may not have the wit of the Thin Man series, but undeniably makes up for it in charm. While I watched it, I thought for sure Powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with Arthur. My friends thought the same. This is one film where I wish I could step back in time (to schmooze and lock lips with Powell!) There seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks!

Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali,Mithi's(Konkona Sen's) elder sister. Shabana Azmi made the best out of Anjali's character for she had to play a strong,responsible,arrogant role of an elder sister who had the full responsibility of her family.

2872,"I didn't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at Earth and this boob says 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'Sure'. And the boob says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?' Pardon me a moment, I think my sides are splitting.<br /><br />When they first get up into orbit the boob says 'The moon is just for looking at! Take me back down!' Watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the G-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (Perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big ""THE END"" on the screen.)<br /><br />We also find out that they can't open the hatch because 'the boob' greased it before they took off. Sure, a space vehicle is going to be 'greased' by a member of the crew, who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesn't know anything about zero gravity. As Baby Huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said, ""That sounds logical!"" The no-gravity-in-space effects are so bad it's painful to watch. (Everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go UP.)<br /><br />How this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10, when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher, is a mystery to me. I really do like old sci-fi movies but this one is not realistic, and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all - it just ruins the movie. I think in retrospect it's not the whole movie I hate so much as the fact that 'the boob' is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship - not even to 'grease the hatch.' OMG. I wonder if he checked the fan belts too. Maybe if they'd left 'the boob' off the trip it might not have been QUITE so excruciating. Even so, it's only average. What everyone else is raving about, I don't know.<br /><br />You want to watch a neat 1950's space movie? 'Rocketship X-M' beats it all to heck. Maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less goofy characters.",movie

2874,"Once again, the posters lied to me.<br /><br />The marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis for this movie, I was expecting to see a townful of grotesques, every man-jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol, peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation; into such a ""den of vice"" would come the clean-shaven hero, shining Gabriel. Instead, the movie was the complete opposite of what I was led to expect.<br /><br />The first few minutes of the film showed us that Middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can, whether fiddling a little to make ends meet, drinking to forget the pain, or watching cock-fighting (chickens, not penises) to while away the boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary.<br /><br />The only (deliberate?) grotesque in the piece was Gabriel, the brainwashed Presbyterian preacher played by Macfadyen, whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury. If I were kind, I would suggest that the Paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is so inept a film-maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie, leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty-plus minutes of dark, hackneyed tedium. My only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of ""guess the accent"" broken up with rounds of ""spot the location."" Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing his brother's child and suffocating his father? Of course not; he's a bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychotic. All the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie, but I suspect that they've just realised what a turkey they've put their names to.<br /><br />The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission have a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise. The only kind thing I can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace ""Superman Returns"" as the worst film of 2006; one hell of an achievement.<br /><br />v1:20061114 v2:20080107",movie

2876,"Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....<br /><br />But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army? That, based on the hammer and sickle, could only have been the People's Revolutionary Army of Mao Tse Dung!!! Never mind the undies and the unwed twosome in bed -- would that logo and that reference have survived during the Cold War? <br /><br />Additional observation 12/27: This film of the 30's with the soviet emblem may/must also reflect the influence on and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of America during the Depression. Adds to the historical value of this terrific film. <br /><br />Also I liked the American Dream aspects of two guys from Winnemucca taking at least part of the world by storm, Red-Blooded (literally and copiously in Jim's case)American Boys.<br /><br />Others have commented more ably than I on the aerobatics, etc. I loved it all.<br /><br />This gem deserved more than the mere 1.5 stars Osborne and Co. rated it on TCM, if only for recording parts of American history of the early 30s.",movie

At that point it became unbearably ridiculous and I put it down, never to pick it up again.

2881,"Scott Bartlett's 'OffOn' is nine minutes of pure craziness. It is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours, and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema. There's no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature ¬ñ particularly the human face and form ¬ñ to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology. In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),' and, indeed, Bartlett's opening sequence of images ¬ñ flashing colours before a close-up human eye ¬ñ recalls Dave Bowman's journey through the Stargate. The visuals are richly-coloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video, as though we're sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a TV monitor}.<br /><br />There appears to be some confusion about the film's release date. IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year. Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening. Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss, either! 'OffOn' captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information. I had a thought ¬ñ and please don't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation ¬ñ that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense. Perhaps this is where Mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.",movie
2882,"Fans of horror comedy will like this one. Others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off. It's sort of a buddy film, with over-the-top violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters, and a lot of craziness.<br /><br />It looks to have been made on a budget of about $100, by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party. There's a lead who's a frustrated nerd, and his loudmouth prank-pulling friend who mocks him about 30 times per second. There's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the film. Whenever this thing and its gnarly-mask wearing driver appear, it's a great scene. There's a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat, and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars. The nerd's friend never shuts his yap, and gets them in one mess after another. Their arguing got on my nerves, but other aspects of the film make up for it.<br /><br />Sight gags poking fun at several ""psycho tormenting and trying to croak somebody"" films are everywhere. Take your pick which one is riffed the most: Hills Have Eyes, Saw, and Jeepers Creepers were some that I recognized.<br /><br />It's enjoyable insanity, if you're in the right frame of mind. Sensory-dulling brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun; it's a good bet that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together.",movie
2883,"Well, I get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don't reflect my experience at all. To me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies. He was a die-hard villain, a no-apologies villain. To me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn't sort of undercut in some way.<br /><br />The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast. There I think maybe the director could have done better. But, to be honest, the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered. But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra Sahi's wife. She may be given little to do, but she does everything with total conviction. I'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience.<br /><br />So if you are in a habit for settling for Bollywood average, you won't get much out of this movie. But if you constantly search for something more, then this might give you some of what you've been missing.",movie

She then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have an RV and graciously offer to help her out- it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road. Especially I-95.<br /><br />Emily Grace is very realistic as Alice, and initially lets the Judith Ivey character help her; buy her decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. At first it is a nice vacation for Alice, who hopes to hook up with her girlfriend, who attends college in Miami. There is interesting cinematography, as the trio drives the RV down to Florida: the rest-stops, bland scenery and eventually beautiful mountains of North Carolina.<br /><br />Eventually there is something awry, and the Ivey character apparently has fabricated stories about her daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a bit sinister.<br /><br />I will not spoil the outcome of this film- but it ends positively as the audience waits in suspense- This film reminded me a bit of Spielberg's ""Duel""- while it was initially not as menacing- the moral of the story is - you never know what people are thinking- especially if you are driving cross-country.

2886,"Let me start by saying I don't recall laughing once during this comedy. From the opening scene, our protagonist Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) shows himself to be a self-absorbed, feeble, and neurotic loser completely unable to cope with the smallest responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word, or forming a coherent thought. I guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression. I guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog, but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature. I didn't get the slightest hint at any point that Solo ever possessed any redeeming character, which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days. No spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because he's a self- absorbed, self-pitying lowlife. I didn't develop any connection with this character. He didn't seem to care, and so neither did I. I actually wanted him to get his kneecaps busted at one point.<br /><br />The dog was not a character in the film. It was simply a prop to be used, neglected, scorned, abused, coveted and disposed of on a whim. So be warned. Even though ""dog"" is in the title, this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers.<br /><br />Scott Caan's role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friend/cad. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I always want to see more of him on screen. Mena Suvari was delightfully repellent. Lynn Collins role of a ""stripper with a heart"" was well acted, but the character was simultaneously absurd and clich√©d, not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and Ribisi.<br /><br />Romantic?

If that's the case then why does it do nothing but rehash the original? This floater doesn't even feel like a movie. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the weird contortionist chick making that annoying croaking sound.<br /><br />A sound on which I'd recommend you not get me started. It was kind of creepy the first time I heard it, but I've heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it's pretty much run its course. And it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it'd be funny to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the movie. Sigh.<br /><br />Folks, YOU'RE NOT FUNNY SO JUST SHUT UP! I promise you, EVERY SINGLE TIME that a character was walking slowly through an empty room (which is approximately 97% of the movie), somebody in the audience would start it up, ""Uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk."" Yes, I know that's a horrible way to replicate the sound with letters, but you get the gist. So then some dude in the audience would giggle, and not to be outdone, deliver his own rendition. I was very close to just walking through the audience and punching random people.<br /><br />I told you not to get me started.<br /><br />There's absolutely nothing about The Grudge 2 that I can recommend. There's not a single original scare or idea in the entire film. There's not one memorable acting performance. Are you a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan? Welp, enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue. Are you an Amber Tamblyn fan?

I didn't jump once during this lametrosity (yeah, I made the word up, deal with it). That's right. Not a single time. The ""scares"" are so manufactured and they are so blatantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value once the ""gotcha"" moment arrives. Watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess - you're always four or five scenes ahead.<br /><br />There are also some weird scenes thrown in that make no sense whatsoever. One that immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back into the jug. Huh? I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot of that during the movie. Laughing. Sighing. Head shaking. Falling asleep (I did twice).<br /><br />The movie even makes a 1/5th-hearted attempt at a plot ""twist."" Wow. It's so bad that I don't think we should even dignify it by labeling it a twist. Did they really think anybody would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the hoodie? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John coming out of the closet.<br /><br />And of course the ending goes the whole non-closure ""look, we might have another sequel"" route. As soon as the credits rolled the audience booed. My sentiments exactly. Had the audience paid money for this turd burger then things would have most likely gotten violent, and I would've gladly led the charge.<br /><br />We learned from The Grudge that there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. Much like a Ben Affleck movie, it's a ""stain"" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred. Well, in The Grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend then its sequel will be rushed out, and more often than not it will be as bad as this and will leave a stain on any theater where the movie shows.<br /><br />THE GIST <br /><br />If you're a total wimp and never saw The Grudge then this might provide a few cheap scares. But I strongly recommend saving your money, otherwise, there's a good chance you'll be the one walking out of the theater with a grudge.",movie

2899,"Okay. So I just got back. Before I start my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to like this movie. I know I've been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film. I didn't.<br /><br />It's not just the fact that every horror clich√© imaginable is in this. And it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare (walking into a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It just wasn't scary. One thing I was surprised about: there was more blood than I thought there was going to be.. which isn't saying much.<br /><br />The film starts off with Donna being dropped off by Lisa's mom at her house. She comes in.. goes upstairs. Camera pans to her father dead on the couch. Spooky. She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. Finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could she tell? He didn't have a spot of blood on him). Killer comes in, Donna hides under bed, mom dies. She runs outside screaming for help. Killer behind her: ""I did it for us."" Cut to therapy session. This confused a lot of people- everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it- and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back. Filler dialogue ensues.<br /><br />THey cut to the chase pretty quick. Few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. Of course the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police/family weren't informed until he's already there). More filler ensues.<br /><br />I'm not going to go on about what happens in the film, because I don't want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan made a post about it already. But on the subjects of deaths: they weren't that exciting. People in the theatre actually laughed out loud (an experience I've never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls) during several of them. One in particular: the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face I've ever seen. The only death involving any blood was Lisa's, and that was pretty scarce. Her throat is slashed, blood (if you can even call it that- it was practically black) splatters on the curtain-thing. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. Um, okay? The movie was one of the most clich√©d I've ever seen. Let's see here.. obligatory close-mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually (you could tell they were struggling). Mandatory backing-up-into-killer. Check. There's also the backing-up-into-lamp scene, but you've all seen that. Oh, you say you want a birds-flying-away scare? Well, you got it! (Yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here). And, of course, the we-have-security-on-all-exits-but-he-still-escaped scene. Shall I go on? I could.<br /><br />For anyone saying the characters weren't stupid, are you kidding me? ""Oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap."" These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. The only likable character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the movie. ""Oh, I just realized the psycho-teacher is here! I must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is being to slow? Guess I'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site!"" Ugh. By the end of the film, they all deserved to die. The only death anyone felt any remorse for was Donna's boyfriend (I can't even remember his name- is that bad?), and by that time, the audience was completely drained out of this scareless, clich√©d film.<br /><br />There were SOME positives- the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well-shot. But that's about it.<br /><br />I'd give it a 1/5, and that's being generous. Just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had a few), and Brittany Snow.<br /><br />Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were boo-ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative. Expect bad legs for this one.",movie

I don't think I can think of another movie, except perhaps Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet that captures that giddy joy that well.<br /><br />The other draw of the movie is the very English eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously.

2904,"...this one just isn't worth the cost of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers have done cannot properly be called filmmaking; rather, they just chose sixteen students of some diversity (though not quite as much diversity as the reviews have suggested) and set them loose. The results are, to be brutally frank, far more often boring, self-indulgent, overwrought and off-puttingly grainy than truly insightful.<br /><br />There are, of course, moments of recognition and identification of the sort only possible in documentary film, but overall there's not much more truth here than in ""Bully"" or, for that matter, a decent TV documentary of the same sort. Though full of talk about sex and sexual diversity and racism, the film brings nothing to the table that will be of use to anyone who has thought about any of these issues with any seriousness. And while certain segments serve absolutely no purpose other than to inject a bit of (admittedly welcome) comic relief, most often the five-minute limit keeps up from becoming emotionally involved with any of the students. An interesting idea, but thumbs down for CHAIN CAMERA.",movie

2906,"I'm not saying that because the production values were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. That shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek? Did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot? It was terrible, the lighting was just plain bad. You could barely see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course not I skipped through most of it, and I don't want to hear anyone say I need to watch the whole thing first to judge it. This film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it's just plain terrible. Awful movie...don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors ""funny"" lines, it's because of how painstakingly bad the production is.",movie
2907,"I've read every adventure of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times and I'm also a fan of ""Les Nuls"" and ""Les Robins des Bois"" and Jamel so I expected a lot from this movie.... and I finally got satisfied. Unlike the first adaptation of Asterix on the big screen (Ast√©rix et Ob√©lix contre C√©sar) which wasn't a real success besides the appearance of Laetitia Casta, this one really captures the spirit of the comic (and we get the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where the story is set and it killed the whole spirit that made Asterix hilarious. In this one all the clothing, the way of talking and everything is identical to Goscinny and Uderzo's work... more, it really stick to the original story with the downside that we know pretty much everything that's going to happen but Alain Chabat gave us a few surprises at the end. I really enjoyed that movie, and everytime that the first sign of boringness starts to appear, Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor I really like, and even if maybe it's mixing it too much, I can't help but to like it. So, if you like Asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in ""Nulle part Ailleurs"" (a french mix of the tonight show and SNL) go see this movie.",movie
2908,"Audiences today will probably watch a film like Ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out. The structure of the film really divorces from sap-happy Hollywood conventions¬óas well as other major theatrical elements. It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light. Films of this nature¬óthe neo-realist films¬ówere made to reflect the darkness felt during post-World War II times. Ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war, including: adultery, conspiracy, murder, pregnancy, etc. Aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments, the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty: shot on-location, uses natural lighting and most likely non-popular actors. All of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film, yielding the following theme: Negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally.<br /><br />The two leads¬óGino and Giovanna¬óare polar opposites, yet both carry the mentality: we're bored and we want to be entertained. Gino is a drifter; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations. Giovanna is a bored house-wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence: she doesn't want to leave her home and husband, but would rather remain where she is because it's safer. Gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle Giovanna craves; the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it herself¬óthat's why she falls in love with Gino: he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get. She wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husband¬óGino is the perfect ticket into that world. The affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy. I mean, films prior to the neo-realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before. To say the least it was probably a bit alarming.<br /><br />In conjunction with the theme, the neo-realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior. Succinctly put, adulterous behavior (as shown in the film) leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives. When Gino and Giovanna conspire with each other to ""eliminate"" Giovanna's husband, karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done. They return to their home: the atmosphere is dark and biting (as can be expected from the neo-realist style). They are not happy; they're actually more depressed. They thought that by eliminating Giovanna's husband that they'd live happier lives, but they were duped. The film ends with Giovanna's death¬óit being in karmic similitude of her husband's death. I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons. Here's why.<br /><br />There's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen, and if so, to what extent. I think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified, but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have. As the subtext of Ossessione asks, is adultery and murder evil? I think the film eagerly responds yes! The adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are. Ironically though, towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other's arms inside the car, the author of the film shows that their happiness is, in fact, a fa√ßade: the car crashes off the cliff and into the river, killing Giovanna; the police arrest Gino. I think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior, in the end karma will come back to haunt them. I agree. I think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfish¬óalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times. This was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that Gino and Giovanna experience in their relationship: he can't handle the pressure of living in Giovanna's husband shadow, so he leaves Giovanna and sleeps with another girl. Such is typical of the insatiable, hedonistic personality.<br /><br />All in all, the film seemed very risky for its time. The audience, however, was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought. Those pre-war, happy-go-lucky films were no longer being believed. Movie-going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters: they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so-called 'sin' because it was a reflection of their own life problems. Ossessione, then, acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading. That is, a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement.",movie

2912,"This movie appears to have designed as a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers film--the plot outline, dance numbers, zippy music and the entire formula is there...except for Ginger! Whether it REALLY was originally intended as a re-pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films. Instead of the usual sidekicks for Fred (such as Eric Blore or Edward Everett Horton), Burns and Allen are used--probably since despite being known as a comedy team, they COULD sing and dance quite well. This actually shocked me, but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional Fred and Ginger numbers were done with either Fred and Gracie or these two along with George. Only once, at the very end, does Ms. Fontaine dance with Fred but it's very brief and with a distant camera shot.<br /><br />And speaking of Burns and Allen, I think I owe it to the team to talk about them in the film. I have never been a fan of their show or their movies. In general, I find Gracie's idiot act very annoying and I have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full-length films. However, in this film I must admit that they were great--not only dancing competently but I actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by Edward Everett Horton very nicely. They were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department.<br /><br />Now as for the rest of the film, it's all a lot of fun and is entertaining. The problem for me, though, was that Joan Fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie--not just because she was acting outside her range (after all, she wasn't a singer or dancer), but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint. Because of this, the usual balance and great boy-girl dialog was lacking. There was also a very charming performance by Harry Watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid--all because he wanted to win a bet! And finally, I loved the Fun House and Tunnel of Love sequence--it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch! Overall, I did like the film quite a bit--it had a lot of charm and excellent writing. Unfortunately, it also featured a bland performance by Ms. Fontaine that knocks off a point--bringing my score for this film to 7.",movie

2915,"Before commenting on kerry's book...lets first seperate the FACTS from the SPIN about kerry so that we can 'Objectively' judge the DNC Presidential nominee!!! BUT, do NOT bother to read the following FACTS (verus SPIN) unless youre 'really' interested in thee TRUTH !!! ====================================================== But 1st, altho I'm not going to dwell on the suspicion of 3 Purple Hearts (from seperate events) within only 4 months. (But, I am REALLY curious as to why kerry still refuses to sign ""form #180""...and release his combat medical records for public observation...WHY?!). ====================================================== Now, as to FACTS about what kerry has really said and done since VietNam...that everyone should be aware of!: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --- His liberal record is clear: from his anti-Vietnam war activities (based upon exaggerated anti-American claims); To his support of the brutal Sandinista regime in Nicaragua (as he openly underminded Reagens attempts to confront them); And also his participation in the Soviet created and supported ""nuclear freeze"" movement...allalong John kerry has most always been on the 'other side'...vigorously campaigning for anti-American causes! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --- Indeed, had he succeeded in his various attacks on the interests of his/our country, a defenseless U.S. would have faced a grim future of living under Soviet nuclear blackmail! Plus, the people of Nicaragua would still be captives of communist dictatorship...(Just as the people of South VietNam have had to suffer under Communism, mostly due to a devided America as a result of all the anti-war protests here at home!). --- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Maybe ypou just dont want to believe the above...so, lets proceed with thee FACTS (you can research for yourself!).====================================================== Tragically, kerry succeeded brilliantly in one of his signature campaigns, helping to condemn the people of South Vietnam to the horrors of life under a communist dictatorship...which today still honors kerry as one of 'THEIR' war heroes! As he preens himself in the glow of misplaced admiration for his 'alleged' heroism during his (ONLY) four months in combat in Vietnam, he carefully shies away from any real discussion of his sordid anti-American activities. He doesn't like to discuss how he 'slandered' his comrades still fighting in the jungles of Vietnam, calling them war criminals and baby killers. (Nor will he sign form #180 that exposes FACTS related to his so many medals in such a short period of time... that reqiured little IF any hospitilizatin!). --------------------------------------------------------- For kerry's valiant service on behalf of the Communist Vietnamese government, Kerry was awarded a special commendation as a ""Hero of communist victory in 1983""... (while he was Lt. Governor of Massachusetts)! Kerry's contribution towards THEIR victory over 'us' was cited by General Vo Nguyen Giap, (the military commander of North Vietnamese forces); when in his 1985 memoir Gen. Giap wrote that: ""IF it were NOT for the disunity created by stateside protests, Hanoi would have ultimately surrendered."" Earlier, the N. VietNam military leader also said that: ""We were losing and demoralized...But; then our political leaders advised that America was NOW devided, and thus with patience and persistance we could eventually prevail!"". (Well, hanoi kerry was 'THEIR' field general back here in America...helping to devide America which lead to our Defeat! For lets NOT forget that America never lost any major battles during the war...which we should of won!). Thus, kerry earned THEIR award, having aided and abetted OUR enemy, as he actually helped to prolong the war which lead to even more American casualties! Today, a photo of Kerry being greeted by Do Muoi, General Secretary of VietNams Communist Party, is displayed in a room dedicated to his anti-war protesters in the Vietnamese Communist War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. ====================================================== Next, during the Reagan administration, Kerry got another chance to turn on his country. In the fall of 1983 the KGB launched an all-out ""peace offensive"" via a welter of front organizations in the U.S. and Europe. A nuclear freeze at that moment would have meant permanently freezing the Soviet ADVANTAGE in troops and weapons... precisely the Kremlin's main objective! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- So, as Kenneth Timmerman wrote in ""The French Betrayal of America: ""...in the United States ""the nuclear freeze movement won the support of key (liberal) Democrats in Congress as well as that of political gadfly Jesse Jackson. Jackson's Operation PUSH joined forces with the Communist Party USA AND the 'Soviet-backed' U.S. Peace Council...in demanding nothing less than the unilateral dismantling of the U.S. Military!"" ---------------------------------------------- - - -----For those to young to remember, the entire nuclear freeze moment was a Soviet initiated and financed attempt to undermine President Reagan's nuclear strategy, which even then was beginning to drive the Soviet Union into an arms race that it could NOT win, and would eventually bankrupt them! UN-fortunately, kerry also reported for duty in that movement...(once again undermining American efforts to confront a brutal enemy!). - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Then in 1985, after elected to the Senate (with the help of the nuclear freeze PAC), kerry spoke at a nuclear freeze conference in Geneva. There he pandered to European pacifists with the absurd claim that: ""IF it were not for the freeze movement, I'm confident that America would not be in Geneva today talking with the Soviets""...(clearly undermining Reagens efforts!). Well, as an early backer of the nuclear freeze movement, kerry had climbed into bed with European leftists who (wrongly) denounced Reagan as a 'reckless cowboy' for daring to counter Soviet SS-20 missile emplacements in Eastern Europe with U.S. Pershing IIs...(which helped us WIN the Cold War...despite kerry's misguided efforts!). --- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Thus, true to his liberal based Appeasement nature..... In 1985 Kerry introduced the Comprehensive Nuclear Freeze Bill, and, also sponsored two amendments to freeze the Strategic Defense Initiative (related to our nuclear development). All of this was in complete opposition to the sucessful policies of the Reagan White House, which was trying to pursue an aggressive strategy of 'keeping up the pressure' on the Evil Soviet Empire. But, History shows that Reagen's strategy ultimately succeeded, despite Kerry's, And, the KGB's efforts to derail it! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - So, IF kerry's liberal based Appeasement legislation had passed, it would have completely undermined the valid policies being pursued by Reagens White House, and thus prolonged the Cold War (very likely to this very day!)! Thus, had kerry been in charge of fighting the Cold War against Communism, the Soviet Union would still exist. Once again kerry backed the ""other side"" at one of the most crucial moments in the Cold War! ====================================================== So, this is the man whom the American people should allow to conduct the War on Terrorism?!. --------------------------------------------------------- Throughout his career Kerry's attitude towards communism has been as NAIVE as his current approach to Terrorism. (Plus, lets not so quickly forget the absurd statement kerry made before the senate in 1971: ""that we can NOT confront Communism all around the world!"". Well, kerry's judgrement was wrong then...just as it's wrong now!). Thus, it seasy to see why that this man now backed by the Communist Party in America (as well as abroad) ! ====================================================== Thus, is it any wonder that Communist terrorists, (such as the Sandinistas in Nicaragua), could always count on his liberal gullibility...as when Daniel Ortega met with Kerry in Managua. Back then Ortega promised to obey the Contadora Act for Peace and in Central America; But, just a few days after meeting with kerry he flew off to Moscow to get a check for $200 Mil from his Soviet masters. Yet, incredibly, even as Ortega was pocketing his Soviet check kerry was on the Senate floor telling congress that they didn't need to support the Contras since Nicaragua was now free of Soviet influence (based upon just a false promise)! -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - For a full account of Kerry's shameful conduct see Dave Eberhart's May 20, 2004 story in NewsMax.com! See thee FACTS yourself about how kerry took Extreme efforts helping the Communist Ortega, and thus Undermining Reagens proper (and successful) efforts trying to confront Communism! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Well, it's no wonder that Kerry has been endorsed by T&oacute;mas Borge, the terrorist-friendly Sandinista leader, (notorious for his brutality when his old communist regime still ruled Nicaragua)?! ====================================================== UN-fortunately, kerry reminds one of the naive Neville Chmaberleign whom lulled the world into a FALSE sense of security based upon his FAILED policy of Appeasement; as he paraded around Europe hailing ""Peace in OUR time"" , after every (FAILED) meeting with Hitler...(which only allowed him to grow stronger during thee time that Hitler's rise could of been PRE-Empted!)! ====================================================== Well, like Neville, kerry's naive Appeasement based 'Liberal' attitude was WRONG before...just as it is Wrong NOW ! --------------------------------------------------------- So, this is the man whom the American people should allow to conduct the War on Terrorism?!.",book

2918,"Some would argue that Argentinean director Esteban Sapir's La Antena is an exercise in anachronistic futility; that, while the silent films to which Sapir's pays homage were at the cutting edge of cinema when they were made, they are outdated today, leaving La Antena a meaningless oddity.<br /><br />I would disagree. Fervently. La Antena melds the conventions of the silent film with 21st century technology, making it the ultimate exercise in post-modern film-making.<br /><br />The film is set in the timeless ""The City Without a Voice"", so called because the citizens have been rendered speechless by Mr. TV, a dictator/media mogul with his hair painted on. The City resembles the titular one in Fritz Lang's seminal Metropolis (1927), perhaps 100 years before that film. It is all expressionist skyscrapers, TV aerials, and animated billboards.<br /><br />The citizens of the City are mollified by La Voz (The Voice), the only person with the gift of speech. Her face perpetually shrouded by a hood (kept on even when she is naked), La Voz is forced to sing on Mr. TV's television network. But when Mr. TV concocts a plan to steal the written word as well, La Voz and her eyeless son join forces with a renegade family in an attempt to return the freedom of speech to the people.<br /><br />La Antena is nothing but pure cinema. Burdening himself with the conventions of the silent film, Sapir has to rely upon images to tell his story. There is sound, most notably in the almost continuous score by Leo Sujatovich. It evokes the best of silent movie music, as well as ingenuously working itself into the film's diegesis, such as the beeping of car horns, or the rhythmic ra-ta-tat-tat of gunfire. And, underlying the whole film is a familiar whirring, as if it were being shown on an ancient projector.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of dialogue as well. But instead of using intertitles, Sapir has the characters' words appear in the frame. They are larger or smaller, filling the screen or hovering meekly in the air, depending on what is being said. Think a more imaginative version of the subtitles in Night Watch (2004).<br /><br />Thankfully, the words don't distract from the images. Which is very fortunate indeed, because La Antena boasts some of the most creative and original images we've seen in a long time, all captured by Cristian Cottet's sumptuous black-and-white photography. There are the expressionist cityscapes. The hooded singer and her eyeless son. There is the city's abandoned aerial, which looks like the decayed remains of some colossal spider. And there's the sinister Dr. Y, whose jabbering mouth is displayed on a television screen attached to his face.<br /><br />La Antena has been criticised for relying too much on its imagery, while skimping on the allegorical depth. But, again, I would disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a mind-control machine shaped like a swastika, or the eyeless boy seemingly crucified on a Star of David, feels out of place, a tad over the top in what is otherwise merely a well-crafted fairy tale.<br /><br />But the lack of overt symbols (the two previous examples aside) works in the film's favour. It allows us to make up our own minds: to decide whether to infer political meaning, to see La Antena as an allegory for fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies, and the power and responsibility of the media; or to just take the film at face value, as a visually stunning adventure through a world simultaneously unique and familiar.<br /><br />The sacrifice of explicit depth in favour of unique imagery may seem like a compromise. But, really, when a film looks as good as this, it's hard to care. There is more imagination and artistry in every frame of La Antena than Hollywood can shake a derivative stick at. Evoking films almost 100 years old might be futile, but in doing so, Sapir may be showing us what is lacking in the films of today. He may be telling us that it is time for another artistic revolution. And he may be right.",movie

2921,"I served as a Corpsman at Parris Island in the late 60's, a little over 10 years after ""The D. I."" was shot. I was in some of the barracks where they filmed some of the indoor scenes. I knew a lot of Drill Instructors and a lot of recruits. I think the movie is as close as any movie to showing the life of a recruit and that of a Drill Instructor. Without a doubt, I think it is the best thing Jack Webb ever did. If you have been in the military, you need to see this movie. This was the way it was. It shows how important it is to take a bunch of raw recruits and turn them into men ready to defend our country. One feature I found fascinating is that most of the characters are played by real Marines, not actors.",movie

The author starts with very basic examples, and shows step-by-step how to increase the complexity to work for a myriad of problems. He also shows how many of the filters used for tracking problems are related (mostly just special cases of a very simple algorithm), and when one should be used instead of another (or in some cases why and how to use multiple filters together). The only downside is that there are multiple typos; perhaps the publisher can fix these in the next edition.",book

The woman in a hurry, Mary(June Clyde), is linked to the death scene; but it is McMillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. Suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene. All the atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not quite the real thing. This flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery/drama and is a nice little escape. Other players include: George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.",movie

2926,"Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting film, and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see.<br /><br />Before I start the review, I would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it, definitely do, as it IS worth watching, and isn't the easiest film in the world to track down.<br /><br />Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is Private Joe Bauers, an Army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws, making him totally average in every way. This, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a standout candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a Prostitute named Rita who was pimped to the project by Upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. Unfortunately, a few days after they are frozen, the top secret project is abandoned, and they are forgotten about.<br /><br />They wake up in 2505, and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times, everyone on Earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp. The way that ""everyman"" Joe Bauers talks is seen as being ""faggy"", much as someone speaking like Shakespeare would ridiculed now, and a former professional wrestler is the President of the United States (actually, this one probably isn't that outrageous really). The best show on TV is called ""Ow! My Balls!"", which admittedly sounds pretty good, and not only is everything spelled wrong, but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording, leaving them to be bunched up at the end.<br /><br />It's a funny premise for film, but this is the problem - Aside from the initial premise, not that much in the movie is truly funny. What I mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself. Obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier.<br /><br />There are some winners in the script, such as Starbucks now offering ""happy endings"", and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood ""electrolytes"", but they are just too few and far between, so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slack-jawed, profanity laden sentence with little to no logic and/or intelligence, then the laughs might be pretty well spaced.<br /><br />It's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to Office Space, because it's a very different film, but as a film, regardless of what came before it, Idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the film.<br /><br />I give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable, but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road.",movie

2928,"Have you ever wondered:1. Why no one ever goes to a philosopher for advice?2. Why one mother had this to say about her son the philosopher: ""He's the kind of doctor who can't help anyone.""?If you're curious about it, simply read the first chapter of this book. Once you have discovered.what we have lost, you will be encouraged to read the rest of the book.""In the beginning Reality was at once being, knowledge and bliss ..."" began the the first sentence of the book. For the purposes of this exceedingly short review, that phrase will be truncated to: ""being and knowledge were one"", on the theory that once you have those two the third will follow. The important part about all three qualities is that they constituted the sacred. But that was a long time ago in the era of the ""primordial religion"", long before even the first ancient texts of the Vedic scriptures were written. The wisdom of that religion however persisted in the lineage of Pythagoras -- Socrates -- Plato -- Plotinus, and even survived intact for the few centuries after them.The author details how Western Civilization gradually lost touch with the wisdom of the ages. In the beginning, all knowledge was sacred, as well as art, music, dancing, and the crafts. The beginning of the decline of philosophy from its pristine wisdom to pure rationalism started with the famous -- or infamous -- enunciation :""Cogito ergo sum,"" of Descartes, ""I think, therefore I am."", entirely ignoring being. Anyway, modern philosophy was born. After that, we were treated to many ""-isms"", from nominalism to existentialism. And, of course, Sartre and his book: ""Being and Nothingness"". That was the final decree. Being and knowledge were officially divorced.Fortunately however, there has been a rediscovery of the traditional wisdom, the two most notable names in this rediscovery being Guenon and Schuon. This book details that rediscovery and shows how not only is all knowledge sacred but how the arts and sciences are fountains of Grace.This is not easy reading. However, it will interest and repay the reader with an interest in tradition as defined by Schuon. All of the ills of the modern world, global warming, overpopulation of the globe, nuclear weapons, etc., etc., etc. can be traced to the decline of traditional wisdom.",book

Oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever conjured up on television. Tom Fontana truly did a brilliant job with the writing. No topic is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is evidence of just how good TV can be. It follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to your everyman Tobias Beecher, in jail for vehicular manslaughter.

2933,"In recent years I have begun reading what everyone calls &quot;The Classics&quot;. Books like War And Peace, Shakespeare and so on. So far, this is the only classic that I can't stand.The first time I said this to my mother (who is one of the biggest fans of this book I've ever seen) she was of the opinion that I needed to read the analysis of the book and then I'd understand the true meaning of it. Well, even after that I still don't think it's so crash hot.What I mean is that &quot;TKAM&quot; is sort of the &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; or &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; of 20th century literature. I can read it, read about 10 analyses of it and then read critiques of the analyses and - despite having my vocabulary enriched with many long words - I'm still none the wiser about what all the fuss is about. Sure I now understand a lot more about the book but it just doesn't seem to be worth all the racket that everyone makes (&quot;You're reading To Kill A Mockingbird? Lucky you! I LOVED that book&quot; and so on).So the book deals with racial prejudice in America's south early this century. So did Martin Luther King. So it deals with growing up in a 1-parent household. Big deal, I can name a good number of people who have done that as well.I guess my main point against &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is that it really doesn't offer anything new in relation to the stuff it deals with. I don't know whether that was neccessarily Harper Lee's intention when she wrote it, but that's definitely the way it's come out now that I read it.Of course, the good thing about it being able to be interpreted in so many ways is that when you do an assignment on it you can. I had the &quot;luck&quot; to be told to do an oral as Atticus and then an essay comparing Atticus to Sir Thomas More in &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;. I wouldn't be surprised if, had I done my oral in exactly the opposite way to that which I did, I would have got the same mark for it - if not higher for &quot;bringing a new perspective to the study&quot;.Don't get me wrong here - &quot;TKAM&quot; is a good book. Well written and so forth. The only problem is that it doesn't really leave you (r me at least) with a satisfied feeling after reading it.If you really want this book then go ahead and buy it. I personally would save my money - but that's just me.",book

2936,"I was captured after the first page. Seth McCullough is a man that all little girls dream of marrying some day. To me, this storyline was reminiscent of a contemporary &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Seth loses the most important person in the world to him - his three-year-old daughter in a tragic accident - she is killed by a drunk driver after her father rescues her from a seedy motel where his wife has taken their daughter along on one of her many romantic rendezvous with just one in a long line of lovers. It takes Seth five long and arduous years to recover physically and mentally, but once he does his only goal is to exact revenge upon David Heaton, the man that took the one good thing in his life away from him. Once his plan is in place, Seth, in his anger and madness, forces David Heaton, the man that killed his daughter, to give his own daughter in return - only there's a catch. Maggie Heaton is a beautiful and talented young woman with a tortured soul. She is forced to go with Seth and live with him until she bears him a child to replace his beloved Caroline. But Seth doesn't realize that this is, possibly, one of the best things to ever happen in Maggie's short life. From here the story develops into one of the most beautiful and romantic tales I've ever read. Seth is scarred on the outside but Maggie, the most beautiful creature Seth has ever laid eyes upon, is far more deeply scarred on the inside. As their lives come together, they learn to care for one another, albeit Seth will not admit his love for her until it is almost too late. The writer was very adept at placing you into every situation, almost to the point of tasting, smelling, and feeling everything that surrounds this couple. Her ability to describe things, places, and people is extraordinary and I cannot begin to tell you how much I felt a part of these people's lives. Seth's and Maggie's families are an intricate part of the storyline, and without them I don't think this book would have been half as good as it was. THE COLOR OF REVENGE is a treasure that is hidden due to the fact that it does not have the luxury of being afforded a high-profile publisher. It is truly a shame because so many people will not be able to read this &quot;gem&quot; due to the fact that it doesn't have the proper marketing. THE COLOR OF REVENGE was recommended to me by a friend, and it took a great deal of time to finally locate it. But if you are lucky enough to find this &quot;treasure&quot;, take the time to read it. A wonderful, gracious story of forgiveness and ultimately, what most of us search for all our lives, true and lasting love. Most importantly, Ms. Hart has given her readers one of the most endearing endings of all time.Enjoy.",book

They meet beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy...and only Simira seems to know what's going on.<br /><br />A real snoozer. I caught this on late night TV when I was about 10. It put me to sleep! Seeing it again all these years later I can see why. It's slow-moving, the mummy doesn't even show up until 40 minutes in (and this is only 66 minutes long!), the acting ranges from bad (Dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neise) and there's no violence or blood to be found. This movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics (involving a silly love triangle) than horror.<br /><br />This rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it straight, there's some good acting from Diane Brewster, it's short and the mummy attack scenes (all three of them) aren't bad. They're not scary just mildly creepy. Still, this movie is pretty bad. A sure fire cure for insomnia.",movie
2938,"There are numerous books out there for coaches that have the same goal as The Perfect Season: to arm the coach with tons of drills at his disposal to get the most out of his players. Unlike other books, these drills aren't needlessly complicated, don't require all kinds of pricey equipment that isn't standard in your bag (you probably want to purchase a tee and some simple cones, but that's all I needed), and won't confuse your children as they try to execute them.Also, Bartlett provides solid estimates for the time to complete every drill, allowing you to mix and match to meet the needs of your team and your timeframe. I've found myself falling in love with many of the drills, and the players do enjoy them. This book doesn't eliminate time spent standing around, but it reduces it exponentially.The drills are good for all ages, as even high school players would benefit from some. However, it's perfect for coaches in 9- and 10-year old leagues, where kids are first able to bunt and steal and coaches struggle to teach and strategize these new tools. If you coach in a league for 9- and/or 10-year olds, I would recommend you order this immediately. Everyone will benefit from it, but that demographic needs it.",book
2939,"Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code film starring some of the best of the era. It is set in the maternity ward of a hospital, particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble.

Her husband (Eric Linden) is at the hospital at every second aching to know that everything will be okay. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is great at her job.<br /><br />This film is highly interesting and entertaining. It isn't terribly shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen. The acting is brilliant all around. Loretta Young is gorgeous here in her prime. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great as always, a staple of pre-codes and for good reason.",movie

Once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all. When asked what happen he says blandly ""attacked by demons, nothing serious."", as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire.<br /><br />I shut it off when they go to ask something-a demon or something, I stopped caring-a ques ion.

Here, we get the usual group of people (an acting troupe) stranded on an island (to which they were invited by a Count ¬ñ since he had become enamored of the leading lady, a dead-ringer for his missing spouse)! The characters are pretty much stereotypes: middle-aged but dashing hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy), demure heroine, sluttish companion (recalling Mae West and emerging the most annoying of the lot!), a meek but devoted stage manager (forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who, for once, gets in on the action, if you know what I mean), an envious housekeeper (nominal star Femi Benussi though, for what it is worth, this is really an ensemble piece), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressionable chambermaid, etc. While the film is not by any means unwatchable, the atrocious dubbing, snail's pace, shoddy production (with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black-and-white film!) and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half-hour do not help matters. Besides, Marcello Giombini's score, though pleasant in itself, comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances; that said, the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one (considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here).",movie

As I dug into it, though, I was amazed at the different experiences Jim has endured simply by growing up Asian in America. Coupled with several of his stories about missionary experiences and speaking engagements at conferences, I truly found myself sucked into the world of global Christianity for the first time. The end result was that I actually began to see missions less as a program or something I did but more an organic part of who I am and what I am called to do.",book
2943,"This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner, something which sets it apart from most films with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also so good in ""Koma"") in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation. He is married for 20 years to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us), and it appears to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers to care for hers and Mr. Lam's former teacher, Choy and Mr. Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the film so good is director Ann Hui's pacing. It takes a while to uncover the secrets of the Lamsm and it all makes sense. The movie is very dramatic and touching. You don't feel any repulsion about the teacher/student situation, something that elevates this film above many with the same plot. It is slow moving, but stay with it. Also, revel in Ms. Mui's wonderful, unglamorous but beautiful performance. She was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time.

2946,"Zukav is a great writer who has the knack for making complex ideas simple. I, like many reviewers, first read his science writing. In fact, ""The Dancing Wu-Li Masters"" was my first intro to quantum theory, which shook my Newtonian worldview. Then, armed with the ideas, I met the math in college physics, and trembled!The ""Seat of the Soul"" is a lot like its predecessor. It takes complex ideas, and presents them in a way we can all understand. The crux of Zukav's spiritual message is if you want to change your life, change your mind. Tune into channel WGOD, so to speak.""Seat"" is a simple wisdom book. It is general, and can be applied to whatever particular spiritual tradition you use, be it Zen, Christianity or Wicca. It does not go into classifications of Divas and Angels and rituals Etc., like so many New Age books do. Its value is its simple, straightforward presentation of the ideas. This directness is a hallmark of good writing.I think that many of the critics here are confused by the style. Since it is so direct, it comes across as didactic to some. It seems that Zukav rewrote the piece to death, since clear communication was his goal. My evidence: so many direct verbs, and barely a passive verb in sight. In fact, the text is as terse and to the point as a business communication is supposed to be. I suggest some of the critics who were put off by the author's ""absolutism"" reread the book with this in mind, since I find the ideas open-ended. Having examined my life through Zukav's prism, and applied his ideas to better myself, I find his philosophy quite sound. You do get what you expect. Amazing.I do have problems, however, with the lack of sources. Some of the ideas clearly came from the Vedic scripture, some from Taoist teachings, others from Judeo-Christian-Islamic sources, and some from Jung. It would do most readers a world of good to see that Zukav, indeed the entire New Age movement, is merely translating ancient religions' mystical understandings into an easily accessible form. I am also not 100% sold on reincarnation, but am willing to keep an open mind.These failings aside, this is a wonderful book, loaded with insight. It has been a pleasure to have made its acquaintance.",book

I saw the book as more than a love story. It shows the many emotions people go through as they mature and change with the world they are presented with. Gone With the Wind should be a required book for anyone who enjoys this genre. The movie is also good, but it doesn't include everything the book has to offer. I laughed and cried, and even though it's long (around 1,000 pages), I loved every moment, and wished it were longer. (It got really good at the end and then it ended)",book
2948,"Brave New World describes a utopian society with total conformity, where Ford is exalted to prophetic proportions, and the motto of Community, Identity, Stability reigns supreme. Is such a world possible?The proposition of total conformity is one of few impossibilities. The idea that a world could exist solely upon procreation and driven by primal urges and electromagnetic golf is simply unattainable, as this novel points out.Utopian society in itself contains inept thinking that it in the most simple of terms will never come into being. Improbability is the word of the century, as more things fall out of the perspective of impossibility, they too will fall vitcim to being shoved aside into the pile of discord.Although I find such a novel impossible of becoming a reality, it is written masterfully and should be recognized as a novel of worth. Huxley's dream of utopia(or does the word nightmare apply?) may never come into being, thoughts such as these have paved the road to infinity, which man has traversed time and time again.",book
2949,"I saw this on DVD with subtitles, which made it a little frustrating to get through, because of the film's length. But I was riveted throughout all of it. That I was fascinated by the characters and always engrossed in the story, despite the subtitles, is a testament to the film's power. It's an amazing piece of work. I have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time. It's easily the best foreign film I've seen in the last twenty years or so. I would like to know the full story behind the making of this film. It must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of locations. Its use of some hardcore scenes (on the TV in the motel room) may unfortunately make some people choose not to see it, but if you don't mind those, you'll be deeply moved by all the stories in this one!",movie

2951,"Okay, I'll say it. This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. This statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film. But the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy. I mean, did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece? Just look at the ""scary"" hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which I thought was just as funny), this movie turned out to be a side-splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue, bad one liners and horrible special effects. And it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers. It certainly worked for me.<br /><br />For example: Anne Tiler (to her troubled husband): What makes you frown so heavily darling?<br /><br />If that chunk of dialogue doesn't make you laugh, then you have serious issues. Who in their right mind would utter those words in real life? Of course, no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous! Just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about Jack Frost 2.",movie
2952,"Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, particularly the nature of addiction, which still resonate strongly today.<br /><br />As for the movie... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and CIRCLING around everything, making the viewer quite nauseous. Why the director didn't put a stop to this is beyond me--but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately-cast actors. All in all, a weak adaptation. Your three hours would be better spent reading (or re-reading) the book.",movie
2953,"Definitely one of the best restaurants in Disney Springs, if not THE best. First of all, shout out to LEO for making our experience even more fantastic! The star of the shows is the Antipasti Tower, hands down. It's a shareable charcuterie plate on steroids, filled with gourmet meats, cheese, and even pickled vegetables. The dates are sour candy. For a more decadent dessert, the Chocolate Paradiso lives up to his name. The dark chocolate and cocoa powder keep the cake light while the caramel drizzle and toffee topping provide a burst of sweetness. We enjoyed their unique offering of a citrus (blood orange, I think?) unsweetened iced tea throughout our meal.

2956,"This is one of those religious horror films which never explain why the forces of ""evil"" are 10,000 times stronger than those of ""good"". We've got here a Satanic cult which can: 1) ""beam away"" people (like in ""Star Trek""), 2) kill through little children's dolls, 3) transfer a soul from one body into another, 4) hypnotize telepathically from a bigger distance, and 5) cause drastic car-crashes in which selected persons turn into spaghetti while others (kids, in this case) survive unscathed.<br /><br />On the other hand, the forces of ""good"" can: 1) sit around helplessly, 2) stand around cluelessly, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time by doing nothing, 6) read comics while people get slaughtered by the dozens, and 7) arrive too late to Satanic rituals.<br /><br />In every religious horror movie I have to assume that that movie's world is inhabited by God and by Satan. I also have to assume that Satan can't be 1,000,000 times more powerful, unless the movie has a world order resembling that of Hell. In other words, where were the priests in this film who knew something? The best that this movie's priest could do is guess that there are some witches about - nothing else - from reading all those books in his study. At the first sight of violence this priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically, only to finish in a major panic attack. So this is supposed to be God's contribution to fighting Satan? Ridiculous. Every good religious horror film has the powers of ""good"" equipped with some form of (more-or-less) supernatural power, or at least SOME concrete knowledge of how to fight ""evil"". In that sense this movie is quite idiotic. As is the casting of the droll Martin to play the high priest(!) of the cult. There is very little menace or awe in watching the quirky Martin lead a Satanic ritual. I mean, it didn't have to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but couldn't they have found someone less funny-looking? Also, why does the couple go back to the town after their car is put out of the running? After their ""friendly"" encounter with the town's folk no sane person would have gone back; they should've just walked on. The man's explanation to his girlfriend (and the viewer) is that ""who knows what's in that direction"".",movie

2959,"<br /><br />Won't be long on this movie. The first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies. The story didn't advanced, nothing was explained about any of the characters. It felt like a non-movie. (A lot of people had already left the audience at this point).<br /><br />A lot of the scene were totally unjustified and unexplained.<br /><br />The director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence, each scene, has to make the story go forward. He never did that.<br /><br />The supposedly funny moments were contrived, and only a few people laughed (people with a weird sense of humor, i guess).<br /><br />Prize of the Jury in Cannes 2002.....don't know what the jury was thinking about....probably the ""politicly correct effect"".<br /><br />I would have loved to love it, the disappointment was therefore even bigger.<br /><br />You have to see it to believe it.

2960,"I completely understand the historical significance of Rocketship X-M, but that doesn't make it a good movie. To begin with, the plot (or what there is of it) is dull and lifeless. Five astronauts blast off for the moon ¬ñ they get knocked off course and end up on Mars (huh?) ¬ñ cavemen-looking Martians throw rocks at them ¬ñ they return to Earth and meet a fiery death ¬ñ The End. Believe it or not, but this pithy plot description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is. To make matters worse, John Emery's character, Dr. Karl Eckstrom, feels it necessary to give long drawn out speeches on everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons. It's just a thrill-a-minute (sarcasm intended).<br /><br />Looking back at Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I would call the portrayal of women funny if it weren't all so sad and misguided. There are a number of examples I could cite, but there's one exchange of dialogue just after take-off between the male chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by the irritating, plastic-haired Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only female crewmember and the constant object of Floyd's often creepy attention) that illustrates the film's attitudes toward women quite nicely: <br /><br />¬ï Floyd: ""I've been wondering, how did a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place."" <br /><br />¬ï Dr. Van Horn: ""I suppose you think that women should only cook and sew and bear children."" <br /><br />¬ï Floyd: ""Isn't that enough?"" <br /><br />I think Floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen!",movie

Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is all good and even with the changing of Robin Hood it all works. Great stories, twists and the way it was shot - to the untrained eye (not that mine is trained) can be miss-interpreted as being ropey but it adds to the films absorption of the audience. With the green hillsides and the contrast of the lush sunny lit forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles - Its great. Personally the definitive interpretation of the Robin Hood legend. I cannot stress how much i think you should watch this, if you get a chance then YOU MUST WATCH IT.",movie

I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde...humma humma humma!! The story is a hoot, the SFX are childish, and the acting (for the most part) stinks. The only redeeming value of this movie is all (and there is a LOT) the nudity & sex scenes. Tame by HBO standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night.

Edmund Purdom is strikingly handsome as an Egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor, juggling three stunning women: a handmaiden Jean Simmons who passively adores him, temptress Bella Darvi who eludes him, and a pharoah's sister Gene Tieney who wants him as HER pharoah. The movie's popularity has not waned, since being re-shown on AMC (preferably in widescreen). Purdom is particulary great, his character apparently striking out with the women, and ending up never married and a ""thinker."" Darvi is amazing and tantalizing in her femme fatale role.

2967,"Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book ""Evil Angels"" and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target.<br /><br />Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who didn't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart.<br /><br />This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.",movie

My hats of to Mr. Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A, which was a treat. A lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame, but Bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic. He was great! Anyway, loved the film.

The problem is the characters in post apocalyptic Liverpool, whilst still driving around in cars, using mobile phones and watching television, have reverted to speaking in Shakespearian language - with a Liverpudlian dialect. Oh dear! Bad enough you might think - but this often lapsed into pure scouse - with comments such as 'eh lah are you a cockney? And was that a Merseyrail announcement during one of the scenes filmed in the underground? Well the good news is that in Post apocalyptic Liverpool - the trains are still running.<br /><br />The characters without exception are badly drawn, wooden and more like charicatures on the lines of the Joker/Penguin in Batman and Robin except there is no real storyline to speak of - or if there is - it is one that doesn't work in a modern setting where half the sets are gloomy and 'Blade runnerish' and the other half are fluorescent garish or just 21st century normal. Costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their everyday clothes (Parkers are big in post apocalyptic Liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing costumes from the leftovers of a fancy dress party?<br /><br />The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most inane fashion imaginable - the tragedy is that this film was made at all.<br /><br />",movie

2975,"I just viewed this great good-natured parody of Night of the Living Dead, and I have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent. This movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery, the supposable abandoned house, the basement and the front lawn. What I especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against. C'mon, we know that toasters, toaster ovens and zip-locks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread. Aside from the cheap acting and voice-overs, this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of Night of the Living Dead, even better than Night of the Living Dead of 1990.<br /><br />I think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread, including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous. Another great reason why I love this movie is that, there is no exception as to what bread is evil, bagels are evil and even communions are evil, which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest. I think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread (i.e. the car scene). I think the end is very worth sticking around.<br /><br />Even though this is a short and that ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D"" is debatably another great parody, it's still recommend as a great horror parody done by, what seems to be college filmmakers. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of Night of the Living Dead and still have respect for the filmmakers. I would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves D-movies and horror parody's, it's just a wonderful little short horror film that's fun to watch and learn.",movie

We order the chicken wings, Tokyo ramen, pigs in a blanket and krabby patty x2. The reviews are true for the wings. They are savory, sweet, crunchy and tangy, basically perfect wings. 

The Tokyo Ramen was filling and comforting. The noodles were light and the chicken was tender and moist.  

I think the two sandwiches/rolls/buns were my favorite. The krabby patty is a deep fried soft shell crab on a buttery light roll with all of the fixings that will have you licking your fingers. So damn good!

2984,"I love this book for all of us who need a daily dose of support. In fact, I have two copies. I have used it so much to reference my different emotional places in life that I bought the hard copy. It has provided me with comforting words of wisdom and encouragement with regard to my human process. No matter what, Melody Beattie gives you the message, &#34;It's okay.&#34; Often, I go to this book like grabbing my &#34;blankie&#34; to cover up when the world is too much.",book
2985,I had a great experience. The burgers were fresh and well cooked. I had the cry fry and the onion rings were so delish. I came with my kids and Ronda was so patient and courteous. The kids really enjoyed the food and can't wait to come back again.,restaurant
2986,"This was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later, the WWE crammed so many matches on it, some of the matches were useless. I'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do.<br /><br />However major highlights included the HUGE pop for Demolition winning the tag team belts from Haku and Andre the Giant, The first ever mixed tag match featuring Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first ever clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan.<br /><br />Some matches were a complete waste of time. Like The Bolsheviks vs The Hart Foundation was only about 40 seconds long, Koko B Ware vs Rick Martel was short and Big Bossman vs Akeem was too short.<br /><br />Mr Perfect vs Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase vs Jake 'the snake' Roberts were very good indeed.<br /><br />Overall Grade - B",movie
2987,"I have watched anime but I'm not a die hard fan; and I don't read manga. I say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background. I have seen ""St. John's Wort,"" and although it isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, it made me pick up ""Shinobi,"" especially since everyone seems to love it.<br /><br />Well, I watched it this afternoon, and fought very hard to keep watching. Yes, it's very beautiful - the slow motion water scenes, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the CGI eye flicker - majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fight scenes, but overall this was dull as dirt.<br /><br />It seemed as if someone took ""Romeo and Juliet"" - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and threw in some ""X-Men"" for good measure. Two of the characters split Wolverine's powers - the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey-haired guy had his ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - that's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such dumb powers? Poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death. Man, that's some great power for you. And the other girl, can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands. The other woman, one of the star crossed lovers, has the power of a hypnotic stare. Wow.<br /><br />I sort of made it to the end of the film, by fast forwarding it, and did see a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some people are comparing this to ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero."" Don't make that mistake. They may share similar endings, but that's where the similarities end. ""Shinobi"" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker.<br /><br />I would say avoid this film unless you're 12 to 18 years old.",movie
2988,"Wow! The sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances. Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti's debut film, i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film. The only other one of his i've seen (at time of writing) is Death in Venice - which was absolutely incredible: more dazzling visually than Ossessione (Obsession). One of the most beautiful films i've ever seen, but its story was not as involving as Ossessione. If you click on ""miscellaneous"" on this page's links, there are stills from the movie on those websites. They won't really do justice to the experience of the movie: such graceful camera movements, such beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such terrific characters, such a great story development, the first movie adapted from James M Cain's ""The Postman Always Rings Twice.""<br /><br />I can't believe this was made in 43, eight years before Brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with Streetcar Named Desire (1951). The actors in this may not have used the method technique, ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves (i don't know anything about it) - but they're some of the best, most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema. Also, eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema! Yes, i'm being superlative, but Ossessione was just that terrific.<br /><br />The reason Ossessione didn't cause the impact Streetcar did was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini, and re-cut in America. American audiences didn't see its full glory till 59, eight years AFTER Streetcar.<br /><br />I won't say any more about it - just writing to tell you its one of the best, most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen, and tell you to go out and see it! Like another reviewer, i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it!",movie
2989,"I love so much about this movie: the music, the cinematography, the acting, the story, and all the Mormon clich√©s. Just because they are clich√©s doesn't mean they aren't true! This is not perfect, it is a movie after all. Though excommunications are held in well-lit rooms with nice big desks and chairs, it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark, cold scene they did in this film. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. I thought that was so cool. I mean, I believe that angels do watch over us. What is one supposed to do while waiting? Smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting. I loved the irony cause Mormons make such a deal about smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake, and cried every time! It blows me away. And I've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. I would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen. I hope the Tower Theatre in Salt Lake will bring it back regularly at General Conference time, as a cult movie (pun intended, but no offense intended).",movie

2991,"Albeit not the greatest book I have read in the series, Blood of the Fold is still quite a good one. The only tiring thing I find about it is the fact that yet again Kahlan and Richard are split up to complete their own separete tasks. I only hope that this will not be the case in the fourth book.The characters are once again fleshed out nicel and everyone is covered. From the insane leader of the Blood of the Fold, his bewitched sister, Gratch and many many others, the story unfolds with suspense that leaves you on the edge of your seat.I also found that Goodkind delved shallowly into the issue of homosexuality, with two lesbians. Although I found the cover good, I also found that I was laughing near the end over the joke between Kahlan and Berdine. The fact that he covered this issue made me feel good. As many books look at it in a negative way. I am glad that this one was different.If you enjoyed the two previous books then I recommend this one also, as it too is full of murder, mystery and many suprises which will keep you readin well into the night.",book
2992,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series is my Dad's favorite, so I decided to buy the first one. I took it to camp with me and it was just amazing. I read the whole thing quickly, and I thought it was hilarious! It's the oddest book you will ever read, and one of the best. Afterwards my Dad, pleased with how much I liked the first one, bought me The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, all five books in one. But I still keep my first book and read it over and over and over again, the 25th Anniversary Edition. If you like surprising, funny books, you should read this one!",book

2995,"This little review and outline packs a lot of information into only about 130 pages. This means it makes for fairly dense reading given the technical level but it's obviously intended for the biochem or serious student. The book consists of 15 chapters ranging from 5 to 20 pages in length, depending on the subject. Key concepts or facts are emphasized and often highlighted in dark gray boxes throughout the text, and some chapters include solved problems. A sampling of the chapter titles includes Proteins; Lipids and Membranes; Enzyme Catalysis and Kinetics; Carhohydrate Metabolism; the Citric Acid Cycle; Nitrogen Metabolism; and Gene Expression and Protein Synthesis.There are about 100 illustrations ranging from graphs and tables to the usual molecular structures and also diagrams of more complex molelcular reactions that require several steps or mechanisms such as the elongation step of polypeptide synthesis, the metabolic pathways of beta oxidation, as well as illustrations of longer ones requiring many steps, like the citric acid cycle, the role of amino transferases and glutamate dehydrogenase in nitrogen metabolism, the urea cycle and metabolism, and others.Overall this is a useful little book that is one of the most concise and informative presentations of the most important concepts in biochemistry that I've seen, and at only nine bucks the price is right too.",book
2996,"Now this place is one of my favorites! I recently came to this Chili's location to have a late afternoon lunch with my friend, and we had a blast.

They have a 3 for $10 menu which was actually AMAZING! The menu had soups, salads, appetizers, sandwiches, and burgers, which is so good for $10.

I got a diet Pepsi, Chicken Enchilada soup, and the Just Bacon Burger. All of the food was extremely tasty and packed with lots of flavor.

For the price, Chili's is an absolute steal. I'm not even sure you could order a full meal like this for $10 from anywhere else.

Come on down and check this place out!",restaurant
2997,"Besides the comments on the technical merits of the production, or lack thereof, the acting is absolutely horrible. What is really scary about this movie is that I actually OWN a copy of it, of course, it was in a bargain bin and had been renamed as ""Dark Harvest 2"", and after having seen it, I can understand why it was in the bargain bin - they should have paid me for taking it out of their inventory.<br /><br />The majority of the movie, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something is going to happen to them. I suspect that the camera that the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. In the maze, he runs into the ghost of some children, which are poorly done, and the movie goes horribly south from there.<br /><br />I can see why they renamed this movie, otherwise, they would never have gotten rid of them. Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever had to sit through, and it wasn't worth the $2 I spent on it.",movie
2998,"So this is the first restaurant I am reviewing in FL and I have been to many prior to coming here. I loved the food from here so much that I had to set time to write this review about this amazing place. 

The thing about eating Indian food outside is it's difficult for me because I cannot eat nightshades and no dairy either. This limits my options/opportunities to eat at Indian restaurants because of the fact that they usually do not accommodate for my unique eating lifestyle. However, Taste of Punjab, not only has dishes that I can eat, they have dishes that are amazingly delicious! 

The Dal Tarka for example is one of my favorite dishes that I cook at home, but the way they cooked it here beats mine by a long shot. I need to sit down and learn the secrets! Ha =) The Onion Bhaji, I never had this before since my go to has always been the Kale Pakora at Mild 2 Spicy (Chicago restaurant). However, the OB, amazing! It's like eating onion rings but not ringy. Seriously, wow! I can't eat onion rings because of the wheat, but here they use chickpea flour! Amazing! It's so yums! I love this restaurant and will be ordering from here and only here going forward. They make dishes with love and flavored just right! I want to live near this restaurant now and be a neighbor =D But am glad to be 30-40 minutes away since I can do a pickup. When the pandemic is over, I will be eating inside this restaurant all the time! -Andrew",restaurant
